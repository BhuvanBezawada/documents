Workplan for moving to github issues.

**What needs to be taken into consideration**

* Open track tickets moved to github issue
  * Do all get moved?
  * How much information must be preserved?
* Trac remain live for getting information back from historical track tickets
* Updating existing Mantid documentation referring to trac
* Critical reports on trac produced from information from github issues (**the sooner we know these, the better**)

**Implementation steps**
