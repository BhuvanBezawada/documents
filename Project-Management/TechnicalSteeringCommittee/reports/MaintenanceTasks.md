For 3.6 maintenance period
--------------------------
1. Move to VS2015 Community Edition. See [notes] (https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Design/VisualStudio-2015.md)
1. Reorganised files in CurveFitting folder [#13347](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/13347)
1. Separate classes in `WorkspaceValidators.h` into separate files, including putting implementations in source files [#11035](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/11035)
1. Remove all cases of `#include <iostream>` from headers and see if they required in source files.
2. Move to ParaView 4.4 or 5.0
3. Investigate breaking issues with updated dependencies
    1. Poco 1.6[#11815](http://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/11815)
    2. oce 0.17 or OpenCascade 6.8

For 3.5 maintenance period
--------------------------
1. Harmonizing external contributions with the rest of mantid (e.g. PSI subpackage) [#12630](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/12630)
1. all systemtests at least work on one platform [skipped system tests](http://developer.mantidproject.org/systemtests/) [#12615](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/12615)
1. Reducing static analysis issues (discus stewards and soft limits)
   1. [pylint](http://builds.mantidproject.org/job/pylint_master)
   2. [coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/335)
   3. [clang](http://builds.mantidproject.org/job/master_clean-clang/)
   6. header analysis (e.g. [include what you use](http://www.mantidproject.org/IWYU) and CLion) - Limited to 2 man days [#12627](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/12627)
   7. Refactoring of specific code areas (load nexus algorithms) - investigate and distribute [#12591](http://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/12591)
   4. ~~CutAndPaste detector~~
   5. gcov (done on `Framework`)
1. Filling in argument list in python bindings (e.g. "self") [#12624](http://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/12624)
1. Enforcing the [C++ coding standards](http://www.mantidproject.org/C%2B%2B_Coding_Standards) (on Framework) [#12625](http://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/12625)
   1. Re-run `clang-format`
   1. Editing actual variable and class names - investigate the discrepancy of our code with that in [C++ coding standards](http://www.mantidproject.org/C%2B%2B_Coding_Standards) and not covered by `clang-format`, max 1 days effort
1. Add `f2py` code to the builds - this is an ongoing process, only complex items remain (translating fortran to python and effectively support as python)
1. Roll out MDUnits and MDFrame wider (Owen)
1. Explore [Mary Poppins](https://github.com/mary-poppins/mary-poppins) as a solution for testers

Too low benefit/priority for this release
-----------------------------------------
1. Proper rpm and deb packages (see previous item) - is this required
1. Making packages properly external - benefit low, current version is effectively frozen this way which is actually good for us.
   1. ANN
   2. GSoap ?
1. Back-port changes from QTIPlot to MantidPlot - 2 man days to produce a shopping list of functionality, benefits and estimates

   
For a different release
-----------------------
1. Move to CMake 3 [#10205](http://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/10205), rework cmake as a whole, re-examine the package structure
1. Move to Qt 5
1. Move to Python 3
1. Investigate breaking issues with updated dependencies
    3. iPython 3.0
