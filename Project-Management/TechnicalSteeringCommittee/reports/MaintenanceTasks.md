For 3.6 maintenance period
--------------------------
1. Move to VS2015 Community Edition. See [notes] (https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Design/VisualStudio-2015.md)
1. Reorganised files in CurveFitting folder [#13347](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/13347)
1. Separate classes in `WorkspaceValidators.h` into separate files, including putting implementations in source files [#11035](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/11035)
1. Remove all cases of `#include <iostream>` from headers (or switch to `iosfwd`) and see if they required in source files.
1. Move to ParaView 4.4 or 5.0
1. Investigate breaking issues with updated dependencies
    1. Poco 1.6 [#11815](http://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/11815) / [design doc](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Design/PocoStringTokenizer.md)
    2. oce 0.17 or OpenCascade 6.8 on mac
1. Estimate time require to move from qwt5 -> qwt6 (results in TSC report)
1. Look in to removing Qt3 suport code [#11891](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/11891) (results in TSC report)
1. Harmonizing external contributions with the rest of mantid (e.g. PSI subpackage) [#12630](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/12630)
1. all systemtests at least work on one platform [skipped system tests](http://developer.mantidproject.org/systemtests/) [#12615](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/12615)
2. Design document for next iteration of testing (splitting small and big system tests, select where they run) - Pete
1. Reducing static analysis issues (discus stewards and soft limits)
   1. [pylint](http://builds.mantidproject.org/job/pylint_master)
   2. [coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/335)
   3. [clang](http://builds.mantidproject.org/job/master_clean-clang/)
   6. header analysis (e.g. [include what you use](http://www.mantidproject.org/IWYU) and CLion) - Limited to 2 man days [#12627](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/12627)
   4. CutAndPaste detector as a job in static analysis tab
7. Rewrite/refactor nexus algorithms - investigate and distribute [#12591](http://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/12591) **needs a proper design and into the release**
1. Clang working on linux. Related to NeutronAtom ([#11542](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/11542), [#9267](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/9267), [#7565](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/7565), [#5670](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/5670)) and a singleton stopping initializing python
1. Filling in argument list in python bindings (e.g. "self") [#12624](http://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/12624)
1. Enforcing the [C++ coding standards](http://www.mantidproject.org/C%2B%2B_Coding_Standards) (on Framework) [#12625](http://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/12625)
   1. Re-run `clang-format` (will likely be done much earlier)
1. Roll out MDUnits and MDFrame wider (Owen)
1. Explore [Mary Poppins](https://github.com/mary-poppins/mary-poppins) as a solution for testers (needs more detail)
2. Move main code directory two levels up
   3. Linux-ify the directory names
   4. Simplify `Framework` only builds (MPI)

Too low benefit/priority for this release
-----------------------------------------
1. Proper rpm and deb packages - is this required
1. Making packages properly external - benefit low, current version is effectively frozen this way which is actually good for us.
   1. ANN
   2. GSoap ?
1. Back-port changes from QTIPlot to MantidPlot - 2 man days to produce a shopping list of functionality, benefits and estimates
5. gcov (done on `Framework`)
1. Enforcing the [C++ coding standards](http://www.mantidproject.org/C%2B%2B_Coding_Standards)
   1. Editing actual variable and class names - investigate the discrepancy of our code with that in [C++ coding standards](http://www.mantidproject.org/C%2B%2B_Coding_Standards) and not covered by `clang-format`, max 1 days effort
1. Add `f2py` code to the builds - this is an ongoing process, only complex items remain (translating fortran to python and effectively support as python)

   
For a different release
-----------------------
1. Move to CMake 3 [#10205](http://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/10205)
1. Move to Qt 5
1. Adding Python 3 compatability
1. Investigate breaking issues with updated dependencies
    3. iPython 4.0 [#13481](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/13481)
1. Rework/clean up cmake as a whole
1. Restructuring `Framework` (and whole package structure) to make building and exporting classes easier
