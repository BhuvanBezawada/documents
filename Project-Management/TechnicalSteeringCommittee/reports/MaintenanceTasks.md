#### Stuart

2. Remove [stale branches](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/branches/stale) after checking with developers which ones they still need.


#### Unassigned (not suitable for pool)
23. Top level code re-org decided at 2016 developer meetings
4. Simplify `Framework` only builds (MPI) 
1. Estimate time require to move from qwt5 -> qwt6 (results in TSC report)
1. Look in to removing Qt3 suport code [#11891](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/11891) (results in TSC report)
1. oclint as a job in static analysis tab
1. Clang working on linux. Related to NeutronAtom ([#11542](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/11542), [#9267](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/9267), [#7565](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/7565), [#5670](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/5670)) and a singleton stopping initializing python
1. Explore [Mary Poppins](https://github.com/mary-poppins/mary-poppins) as a solution for testers (needs more detail)

Too low benefit/priority for this release
-----------------------------------------
1. Proper rpm and deb packages - is this required
1. Making packages properly external - benefit low, current version is effectively frozen this way which is actually good for us.
   1. ANN
   2. GSoap ?
1. Back-port changes from QTIPlot to MantidPlot - 2 man days to produce a shopping list of functionality, benefits and estimates
5. gcov (done on `Framework`)
1. Enforcing the [C++ coding standards](http://www.mantidproject.org/C%2B%2B_Coding_Standards) (on Framework) [#12625](http://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/12625)
   1. Editing actual variable and class names - investigate the discrepancy of our code with that in [C++ coding standards](http://www.mantidproject.org/C%2B%2B_Coding_Standards) and not covered by `clang-format`, max 1 days effort
1. Add `f2py` code to the builds - this is an ongoing process, only complex items remain (translating fortran to python and effectively support as python)


For a different release
-----------------------
1. Move to CMake 3 [#10205](http://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/10205)
1. Move to Qt 5
1. Adding Python 3 compatability
1. Investigate breaking issues with updated dependencies
    3. iPython 4.0 [#13481](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/13481)
1. Rework/clean up cmake as a whole
1. Restructuring `Framework` (and whole package structure) to make building and exporting classes easier

Release 3.7 maintenance
-----------------------
1. Move all Jenkins builds to use Ninja where possible (incl. Windows)
1. Set a consistent policy for symbol visibility on all platforms. Currently on MSVC hides symbols by default.
   - Set [`CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.12/cmake.html#prop_tgt:LANG_VISIBILITY_PRESET) to `hidden` for gcc/clang and fix the builds. 
1. Look at addressing issues shown up by [clang-tidy](http://builds.mantidproject.org/view/Static%20Analysis/job/clang_tidy). Someone needs to look through the issues and first prioritize what we look at, potentially see what the `autofix` can do for us.
   1. [modernize-use-default](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/compare/modernize-use-default) I think we want to move some of these to the header file.
   2. [cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-static-cast-downcast](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/compare/cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-static-cast-downcast) In some of these cases, we need to also check that `dynamic_cast` doesn't return `nullptr`. 
   3. [modernize-loop-convert](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/pull/14989) - ready as PR #14989.
   4. [modernize-use-nullptr](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/pull/14990) - ready as PR #14990.
   5. [readability-simplify-boolean-expr](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/pull/15079)- ready as PR #15079.
   
1. Remove all uses of `boost::assign::list_of` etc. This should now be able to be replaced by brace-initializer lists. [15175](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/15175) 
1. Add the [`-Wsuggest-override`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html) flag when building with GCC 5.1 or later and fix resulting warnings. Consider doing the same for `-Wsuggest-final-types` and `-Wsuggest-final-methods`.
1. replace `std::map::insert(std::make_pair(x,y))` with `std::map::emplace(x,y)` [source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14218042/most-efficient-way-to-assign-values-to-maps) [source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17172080/insert-vs-emplace-vs-operator-in-c-map)
   1. [PR #15104](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/pull/15104)
1. replace `boost:shared_ptr<Widget>(new Widget())` with `with boost::make_shared<Widget>()`
   2. grep for `shared_ptr` and `new` in the same line.
1. profile build time to find which files we should focus on
   2. initial idea: set `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`, and time each command in the generated `compile_commands.json`.

1. If CMake version >=3.1, turn on policy [CMP0053](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.2/policy/CMP0053.html). This policy claims to "dramatically improved CMake configure and generate time"
