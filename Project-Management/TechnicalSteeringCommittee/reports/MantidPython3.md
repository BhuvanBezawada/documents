According to [PEP373](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/), python 2.7 is reaching end of life (EOL) in 2020.
[PEP466](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0466/) outlines the current plans for maintenance up until this point.
Many python projects have [pledged to transition to python 3](http://www.python3statement.org/) before this EOL as well.
Of special note is are ipython dropping python2.7 support in 2019 and
[matplotlib only supporting python3 starting July 2018](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/matplotlib-devel/2016-May/000374.html).
However, because of RHEL's exceedingly slow release cycle, mantid will have to maintain backwards compatibility with python2.7.
