Guidelines and standards
========================
Mantid has quite a few guidelines and standards targeted developers, including code standards, guidelines for writing tests, guidelines for writing algorithms and so on. 

Here the aim is to list remaining areas of developer documentation that has not been covered fully or is currently missing. 

The target audience is here mainly any developer who is new to Mantid and not located within a Mantid team environment.

The target purpose of adding these missing guidelines and standards are to
*	Save time for a developer who for example wants to add a new instrument to Mantid, and want to expand/integrate with/contribute to Mantid
*	Save time for experienced Mantid team members not having to explain the above

Data formats (loaders)
------------
As part of adding a new instrument to Mantid, it may not be the case that an existing data loader can be used, and therefore 
a new data loader needs to be written. 

* No guidelines exist for adding a new loader to Mantid
 * This includes no documentation exists which specifies what information Mantid reads from, for example, ISIS and SNS Nexus files during loading [14561](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/14561)

Contributing through Github
---------------------------
The documentation we have for explaining how to get started with Mantid as a new in-house team member has in general been 
found to be good/sufficient (http://www.mantidproject.org/Category:Development ). However, it has been found
that for a person not located within a existing Mantid developer team can finds it a steep learning curve to 
understand how to start contribute to Mantid. So here the non-trivial exercise of adding better guidelines and standards for
this (perhaps learn from other open source frameworks like django).

Fitting
-------
We currently have
*	No documentation, which gives a good overview of the Mantid fitting framework, which includes a description of how this matches onto the directory structure in CurveFitting
 *	Including almost no documentation about the different minimizers we support ([15014](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/15014))
* No guidelines for adding advanced fit functions, including fit functions whose parameters are functions of other fitting parameters and fit functions containing explicate dependence on units (like [IkedaCarpenterPV](http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/fitfunctions/IkedaCarpenterPV.html))
* No guidelines for how to add a new minimizer and a cost function
* No dedicated guidelines exist for how to best tests new fit functions, minimizers and cost functions, including where this is recommended tests for both for robustness and performance (15078)[https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/15078]

GUI development and integrate non-Mantid code projects with Mantid
---
Guidelines for how to add a new GUI to Mantid and integrat non-Mantid code projects with Mantid.

We currently have the following documentation on this:
* [GUI Design Guidelines](http://www.mantidproject.org/GUI_Design_Guidelines)
* [Integrate non mantid code projects with mantid](http://www.mantidproject.org/Integrate_non_Mantid_code_projects_with_Mantid)
* [Python GUI Control in Mantidplot](http://www.mantidproject.org/Python_GUI_Control_in_MantidPlot)
* [Create a customized input dialog](http://www.mantidproject.org/Writing_a_CustomDialog)

Perhaps majority of documentation there. Maybe links about could benefit from being grouped together.
