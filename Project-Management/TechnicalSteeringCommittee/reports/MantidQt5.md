Mantid requires Qwt 5.2, which requires Qt4 with the Qt3Support
library. Qwt 6 has a different API and the decision was made to switch
1D and 2D plotting to matplotlib

Mantid Depends on QwtPlot3d, which hasn't been updated since
2007-06. It requires Qt4 with the Qt3Support library. Similar
functionality is available in matplotlib and ParaView.

Unofficial patches are required to build with MSVC 2015. What about
MSVC 2017?

2016-12 Qt4 was
[removed from Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commit/05eaba4cd570b000aa85d91a01e2b4d503894f00)
2016-12. pyqt4 was
[moved to the boneyard](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/6817). There
is still an
[unofficial Qt4 tap](https://github.com/cartr/homebrew-qt4). Unofficial patches required to build with El Capitan and Sierra.

ParaView 5.3 will, by default, build against Qt 5. One or two build
servers will keep Qt4.  Utkarsh is planning to keep Qt4 support for
v5.4 (planned for 2017-09), then dropping Qt 4 support.  However, if
there's a strong community push back, they will revisit that plan.
