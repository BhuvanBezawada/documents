Notes from IDF v2 Discussion - 29-Jan-2015
------------------------------------------

* A single common way of describing the instrument
* Need to be able to define arbitrary flight path
* Include all components e.g. components and what they do to the beam
* Moving components (some during a run so that flight path can change)
* Can we build the control system from the instrument definition
* Interchangeable components
* More first-class shapes: simple tubes, tube arrays, detectors with inherent energy resolution, detectors able to record depth ...
* How does sample environment fit in?
* What file format: HDF?
* Instrument that we need to make sure we've covered most things:
  * POLREF
  * LARMOR
  * SEQUOIA
  * VISION
  * HB-3
* Allow arrays of values to override detector positions easily
