Minutes
=======
Present: Anders, Martyn, Stuart, Pete, Ross
Also attending: Steven, Andrei

1. Moved to next meeting as Owen not present
1. Moved to later meeting as not as high priority as other items
1. Martyn raised the question of merging MDEvents & DataObjects before looking at this. It was accepted as a good idea.
    * ACTION: Martyn will look at whether the proposed api for the objects makes sense
1. It was agreed that this would be a good opportunity to abstract the tokenizer behaviour behind our own Kernel::Strings to avoid furture problems such as this.
    * ACTION: Steven H. to look at this.
1. Federico's comments were discussed and it was agreed that the initial low-quality of the code is as big a factor in perceived degradation from changes. It was decided that the work 
to track these measures would not be valuable enough to warrant.
1. ACTION: Anders will look at starting a report for tracking design proposals.
1. The links are already on the wiki so no action needed.
1. ACTION: Anders to start a (long-running) design document for IDF v2
1. ACTION Martyn to add static analysis jobs to Ubuntu pull_request build
