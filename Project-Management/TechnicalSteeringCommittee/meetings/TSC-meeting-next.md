Agenda
======

* Release branches (Pete)
* Review any outstanding external pull request
* Moving to a newer gcc on RHEL6. Decide on who should do the changes (Martyn)
* Change default logging stream to `std::cout` rather than `std::clog` (which is basically `std:cerr`) (Martyn)
* Review of [skipped system tests](http://developer.mantidproject.org/systemtests/)
* Plan for moving to Github Issues (Stuart)
* Should [labels](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/labels) on github conform to a naming standard (i.e. spaces, pascalcase....)?
