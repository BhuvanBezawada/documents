Agenda
======
* Guidelines for algorithm/python algorithm dependencies: - [Example](http://trac.mantidproject.org/mantid/ticket/10341)
* Compiler/system checks in code - Create a global set in Kernel (Martyn)
* Guidelines for modifying existing fitting function (Anders)
* [Threading Building Blocks](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) (TBB) (Hahn)
* Linode maintenance - Security updates, Jenkins backup (Martyn)
* Make suggestion of topics the TSC presents at developer meeting and agenda items for TSC meeting days scheduled during: http://www.mantidproject.org/Category:January_2015_Visit 
* Are you are aware if there exist good documenation for: describe well which documentation needs to updated before fixing a ticket and tested when testing a ticket. If not should this be a maintenance task?

Minutes
=======
* Martyn will create documentation to say not to call python algorithms from c++ algorithm unit tests
* Compiler checks for features should be a maintenance task, and it should be advertised to the developers
* Anders will write up guidelines for modifying existing fitting functions to pass by the TSC. There should be a similar document for algorithms
