New Items
---------
- [Workbench Design](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/pull/49) has superseded [External Python Interfaces](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/pull/40). I would like to include `mslice` has an external project in the current codebase so we can ship it with MantidPlot. The new workbench will include the improved design for external interfaces.
