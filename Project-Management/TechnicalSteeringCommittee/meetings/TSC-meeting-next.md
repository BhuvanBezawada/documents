New Items
---------
* Potential Workshop topic: Unifcation of interactive-/live-/batch-reduction. At least for some instruments separate code/workflows are maintained, this adds maintenance overhead and might be worth addressing before porting more things to MPI (Simon)
* Start made on Geometry requrements [here](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/Instrument-Geometry/Design/Instrument-2.0/requirements-v2.md) (Owen)
* Tracking of volatile unit tests (Owen)
