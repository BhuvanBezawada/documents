Agenda
======

Pinned Topics
-------------
* Review any outstanding external pull request or issues? (Owen)
* Any updates to [tracking design table](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Project-Management/TechnicalSteeringCommittee/reports/TSC-TrackingDesignProposals.md)? (Fede)

New Items
---------
* Technical Debt Topic for Workshop. Preferences on running this? (Simon/Owen)
* Potential Workshop topic: Unifcation of interactive-/live-/batch-reduction. At least for some instruments separate code/workflows are maintained, this adds maintenance overhead and might be worth addressing before porting more things to MPI (Simon)
* Start made on Geometry requrements [here](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/Instrument-Geometry/Design/Instrument-2.0/requirements-v2.md) (Owen) 
* Standardisation & SSC. Loss of namespace, too much code, too many facilities, what can the TSC do to help? (Owen)
* [Survey results](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-N5VB8VDJ/) and additions to the January workshop to reflect it ([digested comments](/Project-Management/TechnicalSteeringCommittee/reports/DeveloperSurveyResults2015.md)) (Owen/Pete)
