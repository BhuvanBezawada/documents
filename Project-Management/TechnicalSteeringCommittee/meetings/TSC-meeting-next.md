# Agenda

1. Are you are aware if there exist good documenation for: describe well which documentation needs to updated before fixing a ticket and tested when testing a ticket. If not should this be a maintenance task?
2. What to do about System tests
3. Moving to cmake external data
4. What to do about slow builds
5. Restructuring mantid (What to do about the dependency tree)
  * Algorithm runtime dependency
  * Core packages
6. dot files for DataProcessingAlgorithms
7. HDF5/Nexus performance tests should be completed? What to do next?
8. Kill off unused headers
9. Encourage people to use Markdown type formats over microsoft formats in documentation?
10. We need a mechanism in the pull request workflow of stopping pull requests being merged unless system tests haver run and passed.

# Actions/Agreed

* Dump cpack for linux. Pete will start looking at the RPMs
* Martyn will look into control files
* Maintenance task to use https://code.google.com/p/include-what-you-use/ via clang
* We are going to move to a slightly newer version of CMAKE to take advantage of key features. Move will be to CMAKE 2.8.12
* Start moving to External Data. Get this working in the following order. 
  1. Move the system test scripts over to the main Mantid repository (Martyn)
  2. Then look at adding the external data
  3. CTest for system tests
  4. Parameterized downstream builds so that pull requests will run system tests
* Move to using public and private features of the Shared libraries in newer CMAKE see above.
* Build improvements should be benchmarked. 40 mins for RHEL6 currently

## Proposed Strategy for Pull Requests handling System Tests is as follows: 


## Idea 1: Don't allow merge of pull requests until system tests pass

* We take the existing route thus far with pull requests
* When the branch is marked as passing incremental a new job queries the open pull requests, and find those marked as passing incrmental builds.
* A new branch is created from master. branches from above are merged in to the same branch.
* The open pull requests are marked with a comment saying ''system tests started''
* The when system tests complete (if successfull) they mark the ticket with ''system tests complete and passing''
* If sytem tests fail, then comment should indicate as such.
* If a branch is causing the system tests to fail then we can add a comment saying ''breaks system tests''
* A don't merge label, should be added. This should be be done in addition of using the comments. This could be done by a bot.
* Another label that says 'In Progress', since we don't necessarily want to merge a feature in even if the system tests etc pass.

Idea 2: Do allow merging, but immediately start up an isolated system test run on that branch
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Would help a lot with figuring out what has broken system tests
* Would help reduce complexity of implementation
* We would get more broken stuff in master
