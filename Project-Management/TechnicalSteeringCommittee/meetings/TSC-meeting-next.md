Agenda
======

Pinned Topics
-------------
* Review any outstanding external pull request or issues? (Owen)
* Any updates to [tracking design table](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Project-Management/TechnicalSteeringCommittee/reports/TSC-TrackingDesignProposals.md)? (Fede)

New Items
---------
* [Pull request template](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/pull/15406)
* Update on [Maintenence tasks](/Project-Management/TechnicalSteeringCommittee/reports/MaintenanceTasks.md)
* Are we supporting Ubuntu 16.04 for Mantid `3.7`? Need to fix [problems](http://builds.mantidproject.org/job/master_clean-ubuntu-16.04) with gsl 2.
* Second pass on "big" TSC items from dev workshop for PMB to prioritize ([1](/Project-Management/TechnicalSteeringCommittee/reports/DevMeetingItems-2016.md), [2](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Project-Management/SSC%20%26%20Strategy%20Collated%20requirements.xlsx), [3](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Project-Management/SSC%20%26%20Strategy%20Task%20list.xlsx))
* QA - Test documents/scripts within the codebase. It's potluck whether the unscripted test process find issues before a release. Should we have a QA section of the repository containing documents (markdown or rst) on how to test specific features? These would then have to be run through before we even go to beta testing (Martyn)

* Start made on Geometry requrements [here](/Design/Instrument-2.0/requirements-v2.md) (Owen)
* Tracking of volatile unit tests (Owen)
* [LiveListener Design](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/pull/7)(Owen)
