Agenda
======

* Review any outstanding external pull request
* Workplan for moving to github issues
* Pros and cons of having `clang-format` provide automatic reporting (Ross)
* Use tcmalloc on Windows: v3.4 supports releasing memory back to the OS. Initial tests suggest much better performance for large workspaces, e.g. faster non-blocking delete (Martyn)
