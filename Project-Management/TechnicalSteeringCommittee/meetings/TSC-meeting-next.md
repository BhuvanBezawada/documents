* Abins is not currently going to be merged into mantid. Anders will talk with the developers about further options for interoperability with mantid.
* Need to better document/advertise how 2nd/3rd party apps interoperate with mantid. This includes solving the "distribution problem."
* matplotlib 1.5+ is now the default in rhel7
* The `TimeSeriesProperty` designed was given comments will appear on the next agenda
* Time ran out for going over maintenance tasks. TSC will meet again in one week to go over that in particular.
