Agenda
======

* Bundle Paraview 4.3 with Mantid (OSX Steve, Martyn/Owen Windows)
* Build server script updates for bundled ParaView (Owen)
* Summarize experience from switching to [leeroy](https://github.com/jfrazelle/leeroy) (Ross)
* Build server jobs and such:
 * Currently on every PR: cppcheck, OSX, RHEL6, RHEL7 (with system tests), Ubuntu, Windows (with usage tests)
 * Should we add pylint or doxygen?
 * What belongs on the [Critical Jobs](http://builds.mantidproject.org/) tab?
* TSC actions from last [PMB minutes](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Project-Management/PMB/Minutes/PMBMinutes29thJan15.docx) 
 * Create a user example for how to integrate non-Mantid code with Mantid
 * Determine what code in Mantid needs validation by scientific expert
* Moving to a newer gcc on RHEL6. Decide on who should do the changes (Martyn)
* Change default logging stream to `std::cout` rather than `std::clog` (which is basically `std:cerr`) (Martyn)
* Review of [skipped system tests](http://developer.mantidproject.org/systemtests/)
* Continue discussion from last TSC on [python api for MDEvents](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Design/pythonAlgorithmsForMDEvents.rst) (Andrei)
 * A way to do this would be to find a way to get user-defined functions looping over the MDEvent data. How do Numpy do this? (Owen)
* [Design proposal](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Design/HandlingMovingInstruments.md) for handling of data from moving instruments (Anders) 
* [MDWorkspace enhancement proposal](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Design/VATES/IMDDimensionUpdate.md) (Owen)

Minutes
=======

* Paraview 4.3 branch bundling has been done, but problem with functionality. 
* Build server script updates for bundled ParaView. Not high priority. Uncertain resource requirement
* Switching to Leeroy has solved null builds issues etc. Overall good improvement. Ross technical documentation for Leeroy, send link when done
* For build server job for every PR: Agree to add doxygen (Ross). Can reference level be set on pylint, technical how to do this (Martyn). Could still allow merging even if pylint fail, and how to make this transparent to developers. Email develpers when Doxygen and pylint added
* Review any outstanding external pull request at future TSC meetings
* Add wiki page with examples for interfacing with Mantid covering different use cases. Perhaps link on contributer.md to this (anders)  
* Agreed to use label for tickets that need science validation. Suggested names for this label during meeting: VALIDATION, SCIENCETOTEST, SCITEST, VALIDSCI. VALIDATION just means to add comment end of ticket saying "this has been validated by so and so". To agree on label
