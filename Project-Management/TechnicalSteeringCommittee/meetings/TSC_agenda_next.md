Agenda
======
* NeXus vs HDF5. What are the next steps? (Owen/Pete)
* Is it a good idea to bundle matplotlib (question from PMB)
* Updating c++ coding standard page http://www.mantidproject.org/C%2B%2B_Coding_Standards to reflect in better detail the standard we use as developers, e.g. naming of attributes of a struct which only holds data members? (Anders/Martyn)
* Dependency for fitting proposed by Michael Wedel at PSI - [Adept](http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/clouds/adept/). He has already written a SPEC file & debian control file in a fork: https://github.com/MichaelWedel/adept-fork
