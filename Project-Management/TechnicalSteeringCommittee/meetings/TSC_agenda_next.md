Minutes
=======
1. Martyn created a ticket #? Stuart created copr repository.  ACTION: Stuart to look into creating a generic mantid copr account. Stuart has set a Mavericks and clang job (using homebrew packages) which builds but tests fail.  We should probably test Mavericks with the latest Intel Compiler.
