Agenda
======

* Review any outstanding external pull request or issues? (Owen)
* Pros and cons of having `clang-format` provide [automatic reporting](http://builds.mantidproject.org/view/All/job/master_clang-format/) (Ross)
* Use tcmalloc on Windows: v3.4 supports releasing memory back to the OS. Initial tests suggest much better performance for large workspaces, e.g. faster non-blocking delete (Martyn)
* [Signing mac executable](http://certhelp.ksoftware.net/support/articles/18835-how-do-i-sign-files-on-mac-osx-) 
* Downstream jobs for PR builds. Or can we otherwise speed things up. Request from Nick D.
