1.Documentation Workflow Proposal 
![Documentation workflow proposal](../../../Design/Documentation/Documentation%20workflow%20option%201.png)

There was some discussion about whether we need to pull in the science specific sections from the wiki (that the users can edit) into the offline documentation.

Martyn gave a quick overview of the sphinxext he wrote and sphinx's doctest extension.  Next step is to write a prototype.
 
2.Anders will update the CONTRIBUTING.md to ask them to contact us first and there should be some mention of preferring small pull requests.
