Agenda
=========


* __`override` and `final` specifiers in Mantid__ (Steven)


* __Saving MDWorkspaces into a ParaView-compatible format__ (Anton)
  * Demo 


* __Questions__
 * Switching between branches - for example working on one, testing a PR on another... this often results in lengthy rebuilds. Using a VM for testing helps but there may be a better way?
 * What is the current policy for adding to the documents?
