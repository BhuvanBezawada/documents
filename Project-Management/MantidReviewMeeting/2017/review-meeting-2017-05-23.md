Agenda
======

* [Maintenance Tasks](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Project-Management/TechnicalSteeringCommittee/reports/MaintenanceTasks.md)

Questions
=========

* Would anybody object to moving the [techniques](http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/api/python/index.html) documentation pages from API/Python to the [main page](http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/) as a new category? This would cover parts of Mantid which don't quite fit into the existing categories (such as scripts which are not algorithms). - DavidFair
