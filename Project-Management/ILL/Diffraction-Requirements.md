This will likely be different from anything used currently in Mantid. A variety of people have some knowledge of this, Nick Draper, Martyn Gigg, Pete Peterson, Shahroz Ahmed and Federico Pouzols.

## Liquid Diffraction

May require implementation of absorption/multiple scattering corrections - Paalman-Pings currently in Mantid.
