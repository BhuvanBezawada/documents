## Meeting notes - 2016/06/14

Participants: Gagik Vardanyan, Vernea Reimund, Eric Pellegrini, Emmanuel Farhi, Miguel Gonzalez, Didier Richard, Antti Soininen, Ian Bush

### ToF Spectroscopy:

#### IN4 (Antti):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Creation of correct IDF
 * Compare inelastic part of spectra
 * More complex reduction script

* Good agreement found when summing in energy and comparing Lamp and Mantid (no SofQW for easier comparison)
* Very good agreement seen when summing over Q and comparing Lamp and Mantid
* Some work on IN4 IDF, for example detector tube shapes

* Work for next week:
 * As before add more data reduction steps, e.g. vanadium
 * Check for correctness of SofQW data, e.g. by comparing diffraction peaks to known values
 * Visit to IN4 on Wednesday to see actual detector banks, and check how banks are grouped

#### IN6 (Ian):

* Looked at similar data comparison as for IN4
* Still some discrepancies looking before SofQW conversion, and larger discrepancies after conversion than seen for IN4
* IDF file needs checking as for IN4

* Work for next week:
 * Finish looking into discrepancies before SofQW conversion
 * Look into IN6 IDF - check with Mark about who to contact
 * Look at the comparison for other IN6 data sets

### IN16B (Verena & Gagik):

* Initial goals for the week:
 * Write down the different steps done by Mantid when reading IN16B data (remove bins outside max. of monitor, normalize to monitor, combining sides, etc.) and how they are applied and discuss with Tilo if/how they should be changed
 * Complete the comparison between Mantid and Lamp
 * Read a series of elastic scans and compare Mantid vs Lamp

* 2 issues created on GitHub:
 * Loading NeXus files - they appear to have changed in Mantid
 * Addressing the two similar implementations of Indirect Calibration
* Discussion with Spencer Howells ongoing - have some 'version 2' files for ILL reduction
* Some outstanding reduction issues provided by SH/Elliot Oram:
 * https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/14653
 * https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/14650
 * https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/14649
 * https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/14578
 * https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/14179
 * https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/14173

* Work for next week:
 * Extend MirrorMode implementation in Python for direct comparison with Lamp
 * Solving issues for Mantid, need to prioritise and update tickets as required
 * Finalise Vanadium comparison
