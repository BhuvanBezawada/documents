## Meeting notes - 2016/07/05

Participants: Gagik Vardanyan, Vernea Reimund,  Eric Pellegrini, Miguel Gonzalez, Antti Soininen, Ian Bush

### ToF Spectroscopy:

#### IN6 (Ian):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Meet with IN6 instrument scientists to verify IN6 IDF
 * Finish generalising IN6 IDF creation to help with IN4 update
 * IN6 comparison for other data sets

* Problem with use of theta angle in detector positions now fixed, so detectors no longer overlap
* Generalisation of some of the IDF creation parts mostly finished
* Document on the geometry on GitHub - still needs IN6 instrument scientists to verify

* Work for next week:
 * Check IN6 instrument scientists agree with current IDF
 * Test IN6 detector efficiency corrections
 * Look at other data sets for IN6

#### IN4 (Antti):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Enjoy holiday in Finland
 * Investigate and compare He3TubeEfficency and DetectorEfficiencyCorUser

* Some work on the Rosace detectors is getting closer for the IN4 instrument definition
* Still a number of outstanding questions, such as position of the rosace detectors (where is r measured to?), length and position of the detector tubes at low angles etc.
* Pull request for DetectorEfficiencyCorUser created
* Outstanding question of where Lamp detector efficiency correction comes from, and if it correct to use still

* Work for next week:
 * Diffraction data validation
 * Finalise Rosace and detector grouping - but some information still unknown
 * Generalised DOS
 * Investigate DGSReduciton workflows

### IN16B:

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Continue with multiple file selection
 * Look into revision of IndirectILLReduction workflow algorithm?
 * Investigate energy transfer incident wavelength
 * Make use of FindPeaks for each spectrum (not summed)

#### Gagik:

* Multiple file loading now merged into Mantid
* More work on complete IndirectILLReduction for IN16B:
 * Integration of multiple file handling
 * Loading of single detector for IN16B - need to verify file flags

#### Venrena:

* Lamp and Mantid now have good agreement for unmirroring (shift operation) - same options created for Mantid
* FindEPP seems to work for elastic peak finding with only a minor modification - difference in where peak position is found between Mantid and Lamp though
* Unit test for unmirroring started

* Work for next week:
 * Finalise implementation of IndirectILLReduction
 * Unit tests for IndirectILLReduction
 * System tests too for complete reduction workflow(?)
 * Documentation of workflow - create a flowchart
 * Summary for Mantid review meeting
