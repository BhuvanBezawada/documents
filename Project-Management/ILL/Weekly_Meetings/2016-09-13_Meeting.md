## Meeting notes - 2016/09/13

Participants: Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Verena Reimund, Miguel Gonzalez, Bjorn Fak, Eric Pellegrini

### ToF Spectroscopy:

#### IN4 (Antti):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Finalise second `DGSReductionILL` - discuss options
 * Some extensions to Mantid algorithms, e.g. for background correction

* Description of approach to workflow algorithm
 * Some workflows depend on sharing vanadium, empty cans etc.
 * Want to avoid recursive algorithm calls
 * Make dependency resolution and data flow separate from algorithm - [WorkflowAlgorithmRunner](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Project-Management/ILL/WorkspaceAlgorithmRunner.md)
 * Decides on order of workflow runs, connects output workspace to inputs
 * General approach, to be used in workflows in the future
 * Should be usable for backscattering, workflows can still be used independently 
* DGSReductionILL in a usable state
 * Needs polishing, testing, documentation
 * Some functionality still to be implemented in other algorithms
 * [List of absorption corrections for BF](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Project-Management/ILL/absorption-algorithms.md)

* Work for next week:
 * `WorkflowAlgorithmRunner` testing, etc.
 * Algorithms for TOF workflow, e.g. flat background

#### Bjorn:

* We need to consider applying smoothing to the empty can
* Not done in Lamp, but some examples in old code, BF to provide more information on this
* Usually done by fitting a peak to the data, and using a polynomial to smooth away from the peak

#### Workflow Helper Algorithms (Ian):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * PR for `MergeRuns`
 * `ExtractMonitorSpectrum`
 * Summing runs
 * ... other things required for ToF workflow

* `MergeRuns` PR opened
 * Also now supports merging files that are already merged
* `SeparateMonitorWorkspace` algorithm created
 * Unit tests still outstanding...
* `CreatesampleWorkspace` - addition of monitors to workspace to test `SeparateMonitorWorkspace`

* Ian also mentioned the code freeze is coming up, so extra time is required for closing pull requests, unscripted testing and maintenance tasks

### IN16B:

#### Verena:

Initial goals for the week:
 * Solution for `MatchPeaks` and more tests
 * Begin implementation of FixedWindowScan

* `MatchPeaks` nearly finished
 * Unit tests good
 * Documentation tests needed running
* `IndirectILLReduction` runs with `MatchPeaks`
* Verena presented a comparison between Lamp and Mantid for IndirectILLReduction
 * Normalisation and Calibration look good
 * Some issues with incompatible workspace x-values

Work for next week:
 * Finish outstanding work for `MatchPeaks`, create PR
 * Begin FixedWindowScan design and implementation
