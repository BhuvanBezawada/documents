## Meeting notes - 2017/01/24

Participants: Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Verena Reimund, Gagik Vardanyan, Miguel Gonzalez, Bjorn Fak, Tilo Seydel

### Gagik - Backscattering

See the [presentation](2017-01-30-Backscattering.pdf) for full details.

Initial goals for the sprint were:
 * Finalize	and	ship the PR	by Louise
 * Implement the automatic EFixed mode in MonteCarloAbsorption by relaxing unit check
 * Add the option in FlatPlatePaalmanPings and CylinderPaalmanPings for EFixed
 * Make adjustments in the GUI, as some unit conversions happen there

Tilo's experience from testing:
 * Generally going well, data handling works well, analysis parts not tested yet.
 * Bug this morning where the machine crashed when saving with Mantid - most likely network issues?
 * Issue with number of entries in a workspace - 1024 (point data) vs 1025 (histogram data). GV pointed out that you can use `ConvertToPointData` to deal with this.

3.9 release
* 3.9 release needs to be built from branch...
