## Meeting notes - 2017/06/06 - Feedback on ToF and Backscattering for PMC Meeting

Participants: Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Gagik Vardanyan, Paolo Mutti, Franck Cecillon, Miguel Gonzalez, Yannick Le Goc, Thomas Hansen, Gabriel Cuello

### Ian - D2B Update

See the [presentation](2017-06-06-D2B.pdf) for more details.

Initial goals for the sprint were:
 * Finish final SpectrumInfo/DetectorInfo changes to support PR for position and rotation moves
 * Review position/rotation moves work
 * Extend `LoadILLDiffraction` to support D2B scans
 * Saving/Loading of new NeXus format from Mantid

Progress:
 * Moving instruments:
  * Core refactoring work done
  * Helper methods to create scanning workspaces
  * `GroupDetectors` compatible with time indexing
  * Detector table shows time indexes
 * D2B IDF needs verification
  * IB to follow up with GC
 * D2B loader is working, for converted NeXus file
  * Further verification is required
  * FC providing further files soon to test with


Merging data:
 * Question on approach to merge data with D2B
 * Current values in NeXus file do not represent accurate position, more of a setpoint
 * PM - real values will be stored, always will have some tolerance
 * GC preferred method was to be able to merge all data
  * Perform some kind of binning or grouping of detectors, with a given tolerance
  * If detectors did not reach a set point still use them with their actual position
  * Normalise then combine the data
  * GC to follow up with Emmanuelle Suard
 * TH also mentioned the need for calibration on D2B
  * Efficiency corrections for tubes - might be possible to apply as for IN5
  * Unstable pixels that might vary between scan points
 * GC to suggest some data for repeated runs

Work for next sprint:
 * Verify D2B IDF and loader, add unit tests, get merged into Mantid
 * Mantid NeXus saving and loading with time indexing information
 * Merging D2B runs
 * D2B workflow

### Gagik - D20 Questions

 * Question about temperature merging
  * TH - inferring temperature in sample is difficult!
  * TH asked about more storing more information, average, variance, skew
 * Questions about when to prevent merging
  * Different wavelengths and different 2&theta; positions should not be merged
 * Question about calibration files for 2&theta; scans
  * TH to provide a calibration file saved from LAMP to HDF
  * TH to also provide IDL script that could be implemented in Mantid to generate the calibration
