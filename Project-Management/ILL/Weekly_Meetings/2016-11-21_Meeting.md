## Backscattering and Future Planning

## Meeting notes - 2016/11/21

Participants: Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Verena Reimund, Miguel Gonzalez, Tilo Seydel (for Backscattering part only), Gagik Vardanyan, Eric Pellegrini

### Backscattering:

[**Presentation**](2016-11-21-Backscattering.pdf)

#### Initial goals were:

* Work for next week:
 * Merging of FWS branch into QENS branches
 * Contact Tilo about energy axis range
 * Detector wise comparison with Lamp -> system tests
 * Python exports for `hasMaskedBins`, `maskedBins` to allow for proper rolling and masking/unmasking appropriately
 * Post-processing for FWS
 * Documentation and tests for FWS

* Multi-algorithm reduction
 * Common parts of QENS and FWS were separated out into a single algorithm
 * Single file treament separated from multiple file treatment
 * `IndirectILLEnergyTransfer` - single file
   * Summing of PSD pixels
   * Monitor normalization
   * Transformation from channel # to energy
   * Transformation of spectra axis to theta
   * Intended to treat single file at a time (or multiple summed)
   * Summing in-situ with MergeRuns and LoadILLIndirect
   * Reduction type and mirror sense deduced from .nxs file
   * Treats all 3 types (QENS, EFWS, IFWS) both with or without mirror sense
   * Works for data from 03/2014 onwards (when the energy, mirror sense and velocity profile are defined in .nxs file)
 * `IndirectILLReductionQENS` - multiple files
   * QENS file filtering
   * Background subtraction
   * Vanadium calibration
   * Unmirroring options
   * 0-7 for mirror sense
   * 0,6,7 without mirror sense
 * `IndirectILLReductionFWS` - multiple files
   * FWS file filtering
   * Background subtraction
   * Vanadium calibration
   * EFWS+IFWS in one go
   * By specifying inclusive range
   * Integration (with automatic range)
   * Scan as a function of sample log
* Mantid vs Lamp comparisons
 * Example shown for QENS, unmirror option 6
   * Results consistent and axes now identical
   * Slight differences in hsoulder due to different peak position estimation
   * Error bars smaller in Mantid
 * Example shown for QENS, unmirror option 7
   * Circularly shifted bins are masked in Mantid
   * Changes the integral slightly, as the area in Mantid is lower with the masking
 * Example shown for FWS
   * Results identical to a high precision
* TS mentioned he had been using Mantid for reduction, and generally everything works well. He would like to be able to reduction straight after.

* Work for next sprint, to open PR:
 * Implement Sum/Interpolate options for empty can and vanadium in FWS
   * Interpolation machinery is ready - done
   * Cubic splines provided by SplineInterpolation for simple cases -done
   * Difficulties with corner cases (2 points, more points then in sample runs)
   * Extrapolation can only be flat, and requires x-axis to be sorted
 * Complete 2 system tests, for QENS and FWS with updated reference histograms
 * Find a nice way to convert time-stamp-like string-type sample log to a numeric value

* Work beyond PR:
 * Moving single detectors (SD)
   * Active SDs are read from .nxs files, but their positions are still statically pre-defined in .xml IDF (moreover, not sure if all the slots are correct)
 * Incorporate absorption corrections into workflow
 * Alternative (lamp-like) way of defining the PSD integration range in IndirectILLEnergyTransfer
   * Right now it is done with .xml grouping file, as inherited from Spencerâ€™s version, not user friendly
   * TS would like the option to set the integration range for the xpert user
 * Make Indirect Analysis tools work also for IN16B reduced data
  * Elwin not required, as this is done in reduction
  * MSD, Conv, Jump Fits all of interest
  * Require data in a certain format, so need to be tweaked to work for IN16B
  * Investigation to what is happening behind the GUI - VR said that these are all algorithms

### Future Planning:

#### TOF (AS):
1. Scripts + validate + refine with Bjorn (to complete during current cycle, Dec'16)
2. Tool to check consistency on files to sum together (not for the moment)
3. Frame overlap (not for the moment, possibly left out)
4. Absorption and self-shielding calculations (Dec'16, but for the moment, just find a way of doing the calculation in reasonable times by selecting few detectors and wavelengths and then interpolating to the full set; it seems ISIS is also considering improving the PaalmanPings algorithms, so check with Sanghamitra Mukhopadhyay or Louise McCann before doing anything)
5. Absolute normalization (Dec'16)
6. Output formats (Basic in Dec'16, to refine progressively, Horace ouptut is already available)
7. Interface (complex, timing?, AS) - see also [interface prototype](2016-11-21-Interface_Prototype.pdf) for example of how this could be laid out

#### BS (GV, VR):
1. Validation with Tilo (to complete during current cycle, Dec'16)
2. Background/normalization for FWS (group or interpolate, Dec'16)
3. Output usable by ISIS analysis tools (Dec'16)
4. Add absorption and self-shielding corrections to workflow (Dec'16)
5. Interface (same as for TOF) - some discussion on whether the same as for TOF is really required. In any case TOF one will be done first and can then be evaluated.

#### Reflectometry (only TOF):
1. Meeting with Thomas Saerbeck (28 Nov, all)
2. Requirement capture document  (28 Nov, all)
3. Show tools/interfaces available in Mantid (28 Nov, IB)
4. Show Cosmos (28 Nov, MG)
5. Analysis of work to do: tasks/development (Dec'16, GV or VR) 

#### Scanning instruments (D7):
1. Tasks? Timeline? (Apr'17?, IB) - these to be set out when Simon Heybrock is back
2. Andrew Wildes writing requirements doc  (Jan'17?)

#### SANS:
1. As REF, but meeting and analysis next year  (Jan'17? Or later if PowDiff first)

#### Powder diffraction:
1. If NeXus files available soon
