## Meeting notes - 2017/06/30 - D20 Meeting

Participants: Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Gagik Vardanyan, Franck Cecillon, Miguel Gonzalez, Thomas Hansen

### Gagik - D20 Update

Gagik provided a demo of the current state of ILL powder diffraction.

Initial goals for the sprint were:
* Finalise the IDFs, merge into Mantid
* Work on `LoadILLDiffraction`, will require some real data file
* Decide on best way to deal with scans, one/multiple workspaces etc. TH and GC said that detector moves would need to be in one workspace (as planned), other scans are used more flexibly.
* Implement scanning detectors in loader for D2B (IB)
* Discuss reduction workflow in next meeting - we will start with powder diffraction

* An initial reduction algorithm exists for D20, `PowderILLDiffraction`.
* Currently there are two converted data sets for testing, covering a temperature scan and two wavelengths
* Normalisation
 * TH requested a no normalisation option
 * Default might need to be instrument specific
* Region-of-Interest
 * 2&theta; range is the normal case
 * Should be able to supply different ranges, e.g. comma separated ranges
 * Could be a requirement for giving range of detector IDs too
* Observable - TH would like some sensible defaults set (e.g. Temperature -> sample.temperature, Pressure -> sample.pressure), plus free option
* TH would like to be easily change the x-axis, possibly including calculation that rely on metadata
 * Manually changing the X-axis via Python should be straightforward
* X-axis normally would be in 2&theata;, and then converted to Q-spacing if required (e.g. for D4). dSpacing not so common, but could be useful, the same for pixel number.
* 2&theta; angles should be negative for detectors that are the other side of the incoming beam direction.
 * This can be used to see the beam stop
 * Would normally truncate this later
 * The 2&theta; position can be offset, needs calibrating for wavelength and shift
* Calibration appears to be good at first look
* GV asked about excluding bad detectors
 * Normally should be excluded, and this is the case for Fullprof
 * These can be masked in Mantid
 * For GSAS the format specifies fixed distances between cells, so the zero counting cells are required
 * Should be possible to interpolate in the saving routine
* TH mentioned that he would like 3D graphs, but matplotlib does not provide this
* Calibration application is done in a separate algorithm
 * To generate the calibration file is a little involved
 * GV and TH to meet to discuss how to do this
 * IDL script exists but is not documented
* ROC correction
 * Effectively a second calibration file
 * Easy to generate, an isotropic scatterer is used and workspaces divided to obtain correction
 * TH to provide example numors for ROC
* Fullprof format number 10 is required
 * Contains x, y, sigma
 * One file per temperature, can add temperature as a comment
 * Naming should be a base name + a numor
 * Always in units of scattering angle
* TH to start testing Mantid
 * GV to provide a Mac build
 * NeXus files are on network drive
* MG asked about background/vanadium corrections
 * TH mentioned this is normally done interactively, to find the best background
* TH asked about the script history
 * Full history is available in Mantid
 * This is saved in Mantid NeXus files
 * Can be copied into a Python script to replay the history 

Work for next sprint:
* Calibration calculation
* Verification and updates for saving to GSAS and Fullprof
* Work on workflow algorithm to address points mentioned
 * ROI options
 * Normalisation options
 * Choice of observable
 * ...
