## Meeting notes - 2017/06/30 - D20 Meeting

Participants: Ian Bush, Gagik Vardanyan, Franck Cecillon, Miguel Gonzalez, Thomas Hansen, Gabriel Cuello, Paolo Mutti

### Ian - D2B Update

Ian provided a demo of the current D2B progress.

See the [presentation](2017-09-22-D2B.pdf) for more details.

Initial goals were:
 * Verify D2B IDF and loader, add unit tests, get merged into Mantid
 * Mantid NeXus saving and loading with time indexing information
 * Merging D2B runs
 * D2B workflow

Current progress:
 * Detector Scan
   * Performance improved for loading detector scan workspaces
   * Sync scans have same time intervals for all detectors
   * MergeRuns supports detector scan workspaces
 * Loader and IDF complete
   * Instrument was mirrored in Mantid - now fixed
   * Tube 1 is at angle 6.25&deg;, angle from NeXus file to rotate is for tube 128&deg;
 * Demo
   * `SumOverlappingTubes` - combines data for scans
   * 'Binning' for scattering angle can be chosen, either just a step size or a max, min and step size
   * Component can give the height axis, or this can be given as max, min and step size
   * Tolerance can be given for scattering angle, after this data is split
   * Normalisation option to adjust for number of entries in bin
   * Comparison with Lamp shown, some discrepancies seen
   * TH asked about the straightening of tubes, not done here, point for further discussion

Work to do:
 * `SumOverlappingTubes`
   * Work needed for error propagation, progress and documentation
 * Normalisation
   * `NormaliseToMonitor` requires detector scan support - now there is more than one monitor
 * D2B Calibration
   * Will need to adapt loader once we have the calibrated D2B files
   * Check calibrated results against Lamp
   * Generation of calibration files will need to be discussed - done differently on all four powder diffraction instruments

### Gagik - D20 Update

See the [presentation](2017-09-22-D20.pdf) for more details.

Initial goals were:
* Calibration calculation
* Verification and updates for saving to GSAS and Fullprof
* Work on workflow algorithm to address points mentioned
  * ROI options
  * Normalisation options
  * Choice of observable
  * ...

Current progress:
* Instrument geometry and loader completed
  * Fixes appleid to the 2&theta; rotation angle and dead pixel positions
  * Good match with LAMP
* Scanning detector loaded (for calibration)
* Reduction algorithm
  * Options for calibration file, ROC file, normalisation, ROI, scanned observable and output units
* Calibration algorithm
  * Similar results to Lamp
  * Mean, median and maximum likelihood methods are implemented
  * Takes around 1m 30s for media or mean
  * Max likelihood currently slow (~45m) - potential to investigate speed up with C++
  * Monitor normalisation
  * ROI and time normalisation - desired, to be completed
  * Assumption that scan step is integer multiple of pixel size - should be sufficient for now
  * By comparing the calibration on both calibrated and uncalibrated vanadium a drift of ~1.5% can be seen, not a problem for now
  * Errors seem to be correct for the calibration
  * The steep fall at the end of the scan is as expected
* Fullprof export
  * Mantid algorithm `SaveFocusedXYE` seems to work
  * Temperature needs adding to head of file
  * Dead pixel cropping needs completing

Work to do:
* Finalise D20 calibration
* Build a package so TH can test
* Code cleanup and optimisation
* Unit testing and system testing
* Documentation and usage examples
* GSAS export
  * Can Mantid `SaveGSS` algorithm help?
  * Need to figure exat format required
* ROC correction - data required
* Omega Scan - data required
* D1B testing - data required
