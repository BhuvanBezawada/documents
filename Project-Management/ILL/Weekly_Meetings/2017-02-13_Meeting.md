### Verena - Reflectometry Progress Update

See the [presentation](2017-02-13-Reflectometry.pdf) for more details.

Initial goals for the sprint were:
 * Continue comparison and understand differences between COSMOS and `ReflectometryReductionOne` algorithm

Progress:
 * The requirements for Mantid follow what is implemented in COSMOS
 * Loader:
  * Optional wavelenght conversion
  * Scattering angle
  * Optional direct beam - x-axis correction depends on this being present
 * Direct beam
  * Should direct beam be loaded and treated as part of the main load routine, or separately?
  * Same direct beam is required for a number of files
  * Possible to use the 'wrong' direct beam - so do not want to check ToF axis necessarily, the workspace dimensions just need to match
  * Want to look at DB and RB side by side
 * [ISIS reflectometry has been updated for Mantid v3.9](http://docs.mantidproject.org/v3.9.0/release/v3.9.0/reflectometry.html)
 * ISIS use `ReflectometryReductionOne` (RRO) and `ReflectometryReductionOneAuto` (RROA), the latter works out parameters automatically, designed for user use
 * Differences between Lamp/COSMOS, Mantid (ISIS), Mantid (ILL)
  * ISIS have DB and RB in a single file, while Mantid for ILL currently has an optional load
  * Binning at ISIS done automatically from monitor range in RROA
  * Scattering angle, Lamp has options for sample angle, detector angle, user defined and coherent and incoherent, now in Mantid, will ISIS use instrument definition
  * ISIS move detectors during reduction, or can set theta input option in RROA
  * ILL - COSMOS uses fitting for scattering angle computation
 * Could choose options for defaults according to facility for RROA
 * At ISIS transmission correction similar to DB correction for ILL
 * ASCII files - mostly use actual values for metadata, sometimes use target (setpoint) values - FS to check what is present in the NeXus files
 * Loader status:
  * Monitor errors
  * Wavelength conversion
  * Scattering angle
  * New inputs
 * Reduction - tests for basic runs, some difference still seen
 * Example script 
  * Uses a grouping pattern running from 2-257
  * TS enquired about this, expecting 1-256, accounted for by monitor
  * Users would likely not need to see this anyway
  * Possibility to put monitors at the end of workspace, or extract to a separate workspace
 * Initial comparison not up to date - but shows differences between COSMOS and Mantid
  * TS was not sure the COSMOS reduction looked like good data
 * TS mentioned that at ILL resolution changes with wavelength, so stitching is not possible, unlike at ISIS
 * TS also mentioned that a water run at ILL is called a flood file at ISIS
 * MG asked about the requirement for Figaro to use the monitor in place of the direct beam - this is still required
 * SNS similar reduction to ISIS, as far as is known

Work for next sprint:
 * Look into differences with reduction
 * Figaro data loading
 * Talk to ISIS instrument scientists about pre-loading steps done (TS has a list of contacts)
 * TS away after 9th March, VR, TS and FS should meet before then
