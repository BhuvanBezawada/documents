## ToF Spectroscopy

## Meeting notes - 2016/12/05

Participants: Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Verena Reimund, Gagik Vardanyan, Bjorn Fak

### Antti

Initial goals for the sprint were:
 * Concentrate on getting `DirectILLReduction` for use by BF
  * PR for IN4
  * Demo scripts
  * Unit testing - question about how to keep it while keeping it script like?

* BF testing `DirectILLReduction` - so far he has tested up to vanadium
* Fixed bugs in `CalculateFlatBackground`
 * This is now merged
 * BF asked about errors - suggested they should be calculated in such a way to minimise the size of the error bars
* ToF Axis problems in progress
 * This is the issue with setting the ToF axis when loading
 * Currently it is calculated from the maximum spectra, this means workspaces can end up with different ToF axes
 * A reference workspace can be used to get around this - but still some problems with this approach
 * `ConvertUnits` needs it to be correct with respect to `Ei`, `L1` and `L2`
 * Plan is to load it based on the values in the NeXus file
 * This is somewhat arbitrary, but will give compatible workspaces
 * This would leave the elastic peak in the wrong position...
 * ... so a correction needs be applied before converting to energy transfer
 * BF said that the ToF entry should be correct to a channel or two, AS - this not always present in IN4 files
 * Could be methods for working it out based on chopper information, but this is not understood for all instruments
* IN4 IDF has now been merged to master
 * BF asked about IN6 IDF - this is also merged
* Work on clean-up in Mantid's unit test helpers

Work for next sprint:
 * Improve reporting/logging - report at the end of running the algorithm
 * Fix issues with determination of `Ei`
 * Possibility to implement masking based on instrument components
 * Unit tests and refactoring
 * Automatic rebinning - `Regroup` can not be used with `SofQW` due to unequal bin sizes
 * Lamp's `sumbanks` equivalent - should be able to use `GroupDetectors`
  * BF mentioned some ideas for the problem where detectors can overlap on IN4
 * GUI
 * Absorption corrections

Antti plans to have a regular update for the IN4 machine every Friday - to give Bjorn a chance to test updates.
