## Meeting notes - 2016/09/06

Participants: Gagik Vardanyan, Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Verena Reimund, Miguel Gonzalez, Bjorn Fak, Eric Pellegrini


### ToF Spectroscopy:

#### IN6 (Ian):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * MergeRuns
  * Time Series data
  * `MergeRuns` extra arguments

* Ian demonstrated the `MergeRuns` algorithm
 * Work largely complete, some bugs to squash, documentation to complete
 * Discussed about merging without having to load all files - `MergeRuns` should be able to merge sample logs for workspaces, even where one or more workspaces already have merged logs
* Ian demonstrated the `ISISIndirectDiffractionReduction` as an example for the workflow algorithms (see notes from end of previous meeting)
 * Showed how script can be obtained from the histroy
 * Showed how the Python workflow algorithm can be found

* Work for next week:
 * PR for `MergeRuns`
 * `ExtractMonitorSpectrum`
 * Summing runs
 * ... other things required for ToF workflow

#### Bjorn:

* Detector efficiencies still under investigation - ultimately needs agreement of instrument scientists
* Multi wavelength mode will be required for IN4
 * Choppers can let through multiple wavelengths
 * This gives rise to multiple elastic peaks (and some overlap risk)
 * MG to get an example
* Absorption corrections - possibility of Masters student to look into this
 * AS to provide a summary of algorithms in Mantid to BF

#### IN4 (Antti):

* Work for next week:
 * `GetEiMonDet` work continues
 * Look into MLZ data reduction further

* `DetectorEfficicencyCorUser` - pending further input from instrument scientists
* ToF workflow algorithm
 * MLZ algorithm was discussed - but decided to build our own
 * Prototype for `DGSReductionILL` created
 * Handles dataset and dependencies between them
 * Not easily user accessible - work on a simplified algorithm
* PRs reviewed
 * ToFToF reduction workflow GUI
 * Update class_maker.py scripts

* Work for next week:
 * Finalise second `DGSReductionILL` - discuss options
 * Some extensions to Mantid algorithms, e.g. for background correction

### IN16B:

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * More tests for ILLReduction
 * VR: `MatchPeakPosition` tests for class
 * VR: Start fixed window scan implementation
 * VR: Make a release with CPack
 * GV: Slight modification of `SelectNexusFilesByMetadata` to not to alter the input algebra
 * GV: Implement all properties of `MWRunFiles` GUI widget to `DataSelector` widget (multiple files, etc.)
 * GV: Investigate the possibility of allowing a `MultipleFileProperty` to be optional
 * GV: Make all the auxiliary files (background,vanadium,calibration) also to allow multiple files
 * GV: Move plot and save from python to GUI
 * GV: Treat the calibration file case
 * GV: Get rid of check_QENS method and call `SelectNexusFilesByMetadata` before the loading instead
 * IDF for IN16B

#### Gagik:

* MultipleFileProperty to support OptionalLoad - done pending review
 * Save, Directory options ignored for now
* Patch to SelectNexusFilesByMetadata to handle '+' operator - done pending review
 * Summing workspaces with different profiles should be dealt with by `MergeRuns`
* DataSelector GUI widget to support MWRunFiles and WorkspaceSelector - done, needs tests
 * Problem with selecting empty sometimes
* PR reviewed - Move plot and save from Python to GUI for Indirect ISIS Reduction

* Work for next week:
 * Move `plot()` and `save()` from `IndirectILLReduction` Python algorithm to GUI, as per reviewed PR
 * Fix setting of IN16B as default instrument in tests
 * Configure background, vanadium, calibration to be optional multiple files
 * System test for complete set of options (calibration, background, unmirror 7)
 * Documentation of GUI to be consistent with algorithm documentation
 * Review PR to enable OpenMP on Mac OS with clang 3.7

#### Verena:

* Example of `IndirectILLReduction` algorithm history unroll
* `MatchPeaks` algorithm
 * Many properties defined
 * Some issues with tests giving inconsistent results
* Comparison between Lamp and Mantid for normalisation, calibration, shifting
* Investigation work for Fixed Window Scan - investigated Lamp implementation

Work for next week:
 * Solution for `MatchPeaks` and more tests
 * Begin implementation of FixedWindowScan
