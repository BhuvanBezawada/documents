## Meeting notes - 2016/08/09

Participants: Gagik Vardanyan, Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Verena Reimund, Bjorn Fak

### IN16B:

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Continue with resolving the merger unmirror/calibration for multiple files
 * Work on Fixed Window Scans

* QENS reduction close to finished
* Unmirror options work
* Calibration implemented
* Multiple files, and debug mode in place
* Documentation written
* GUI nearly completed
* Number of PRs closed, for FindEPP generalisation, MaskBins NaN/Inf with 0, MultipleFile loading (follow up bug), masked bins showing as highlighted in grey

* Work for next week:
 * VR - Shift Spectra method, fix masking, preserve metadata, add unit test, split into separate algorithm (?)
 * VR - Prefix for temporary workspaces
 * GV - Fix `graphviz` issue for building docs
 * GV - Caching for vanadium run for multiple files
 * GV - Alternative to debug mode?
 * GV - Finish GUI tweaks

### ToF Spectroscopy:

#### IN6 (Ian):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Finish `MergeRuns` extension
 * Merge IN6 IDF changes
 * Look into IN6 detector efficiency further
 * ToF Workflow Algorithm

* IN6 IDF and loader changes awaiting review
* Idea to have monitors in a separate workspace, investigated, but does not work well with `Load` for multiple files
* Ticket to create separate `SeparateMonitorSpectra` algorithm
* BF agreed the idea was good to keep monitor workspace separate
* `LoadILL` renamed to `LoadILLINX`, some unit tests for IN4/6 loading added
* Work on MergeRuns:
 * Behaviours being implemented are Average, Min, Max, Sum, List, Warn, Fail
 * List of sample logs on [Google Docs](https://goo.gl/d4uBTf) , IN4/6 Sample Logs sheets show what is loaded into Mantid
 * BF - need tolerance for Warn/Fail, Fail should stop single file being merged
 * BF - Some NeXus entires in wrong category, repetition period missing

* Work for next week:
 * Work on `MergeRuns`:
   * Finish implementation, tests
   * Tolerances
   * Fail stop single file being merged
 * ToF Workflow...

#### IN4 (Antti):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Document IN4 IDF
 * Implementation of `GetEiMonDet`

* [IN4 IDF Geometry doc](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Project-Management/ILL/Instrument_Definitions/IN4/IN4_Geometry.md) - helped to fix some issues
* Started work on `GetEiMonDet` version 2, for incident energy calibration
* Difficulty in algorithm as monitor and detector pulses can be from different frames
* BF - this can vary for different runs depending on how instrument is set up, 
* BF - should talk to Stephane Rols about this when he is back

* Work for next week:
 * `GetEiMonDet` may needto wait until meeting with Stephane Rols
 * Pick up other tickets from ToF Workflow
