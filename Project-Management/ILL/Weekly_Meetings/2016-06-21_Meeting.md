## Meeting notes - 2016/06/21

Participants: Gagik Vardanyan, Vernea Reimund, Eric Pellegrini, Miguel Gonzalez, Didier Richard, Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Tilo Seydel

### ToF Spectroscopy:

#### IN4 (Antti):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * As before add more data reduction steps, e.g. vanadium
 * Check for correctness of SofQW data, e.g. by comparing diffraction peaks to known values
 * Visit to IN4 on Wednesday to see actual detector banks, and check how banks are grouped

* Detector efficiency correction looked at, Mantid algorithm DetectorEfficiencyCorUser seems to do something a little different to what is in Lamp
* GDOS - Generalised density of states compare in Lamp and Mantid, Mantid takes an S(q,w) workspace while Lamp works with S(w), leads to a difference in the results
* IN4 Instrument definition - to be looked at on Thursday

* Work for next week:
 * Investigate why the current detector efficiency does what it does, also inverstigate He3TubeEfficiency in Mantid
 * Look at IN4 diffraction data supplied by Mark
 * Visual inspection of IN4 for detector configuration

#### IN6 (Ian):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Finish looking into discrepancies before SofQW conversion
 * Look into IN6 IDF - check with Mark about who to contact
 * Look at the comparison for other IN6 data sets

* Looked at difference in data reduction - good match with just the middle detector bank but still some differences in SofQW correction
* Initial work on IDF - information obtained on IN6 detector geometry to update current version

* Work for next week:
 * Finish creation of updated IN6 Instrument Definition File â€“ and check understanding of detector positions (also to help with IN4 dataset)
 * IN6 comparison for other data sets
 * (Also try tidying up reduction script with Gagik's load changes for multiple files)

### IN16B:

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Extend MirrorMode implementation in Python for direct comparison with Lamp
 * Solving issues for Mantid, need to prioritise and update tickets as required
 * Finalise Vanadium comparison

#### Gagik:

* Identified requirements for Mantid and some thought to priorities (see presentation), helped by a Skype with Elliot Oram 
* Loading of new IN16B files pending review (GitHub Issue #16588)
* Loading of multiple files in progress
* Question on when to sum - before and after reduction may be required
* Question on unused single detectors - Tilo says NeXus file contains whether they should be used or not
* Cropping energy channels - Tilo/Miguel suggests workspaces should not be cropped for now, but treat like Lamp
* Unmirror options - option 6/7 should be used by user as default, option 4/5 desired too, 0 - 3 already exist

#### Venrena:

* Double vanadium calibration scripts to be merged - in progress (GitHub Issue #16599)
* Comparison of left and right workspaces in Mantid and Lamp, good agreement, fixed 16 channel offset for right workspace
* Comparison after loading of IN16B_xxx_group
* Comparison of vanadium calibration

* Work for next week:
 * Finish multiple load files
 * Energy channel cropping - do Lamp way
 * Discrepancies between Lamp and Mantid after loading IN16B data/vanadium
 * Vanadium calibration opitions
