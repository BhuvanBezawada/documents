## Meeting notes - 2016/07/13

Participants: Gagik Vardanyan, Vernea Reimund,  Miguel Gonzalez, Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Bjorn Fak

### ToF Spectroscopy:

#### IN4 (Antti):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Diffraction data validation
 * Finalise Rosace and detector grouping - but some information still unknown
 * Generalised DOS
 * Investigate DGSReduciton workflows

* [Outline for ToF data reduction workflow created](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/
blob/master/Project-Management/ILL/TOF_and_
BS/Mantid_workflow_proposal.md)
* Comparison to neutron diffraction - not so clear for IN4 but suggested by BF that IN5 has better coverage in detector angle so should be more accurate
* Generalised density of states - peaks in same place (when switching off energy shift in Lamp), BF suggested need for simulated data for verificatoin
* Susceptibility - LAMP routine is `kis` - BF not used much?, Mantid algorithm `ApplyDetailedBalanced` is similar
* ComputeCalibrationCoefVan - adjusts for Vanadium normalisation in Lamp by Debye-Waller factor, but does not use most accurate formula

* Work for next week:
 * Decide on ToF data reduction workflow
 * IDF - wide angle detector grouping, revise rosace
 * Absorption correction algorithms

#### IN6 (Ian):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Check IN6 instrument scientists agree with current IDF
 * Test IN6 detector efficiency corrections
 * Look at other data sets for IN6

* IN6 detector efficency - update tried in Mantid, but BF has better efficency calculations
* Two anomalous points in S(phi,E) plot - different detector masking?
* Other IN6 examples

* Work for next week:
 * Get confirmation on IN6 IDF and detector efficiencies
 * Discrepancies in two points for IN6 S(phi,E) plot
 * ToF workflow

**Action for BF, IB, AS and MG - Meet with Bjorn on Monday at 10 am**

### IN16B:

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Finalise implementation of IndirectILLReduction
 * Unit tests for IndirectILLReduction
 * System tests too for complete reduction workflow(?)
 * Documentation of workflow - create a flowchart
 * Summary for Mantid review meeting

#### Venrena:

* IndirectILLReduction - changes tow workflow shown, a number of steps removed
* Validation of new reduction routine - some small fixes left, BF - should keep ToF axis 
* Reasonable agreement now for IndirectILLReduction between Mantid and Lamp

#### Gagik:

* Single detector treament adjusted, for 8 optional detectors
* Question of what to do in IDF as tubes used changes - either in Load or in a separate algorithm mask detectors?

* Work for next week:
 * Start to finalise workflow - discuss further with MG Monday afternoon
 * Generalisation of FindEPP - move category
 * ShiftCircular - need to determine if this is really needed and implement
