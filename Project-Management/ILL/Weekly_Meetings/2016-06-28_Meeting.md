## Meeting notes - 2016/06/28

Participants: Gagik Vardanyan, Vernea Reimund,  Emmanuel Farhi, Eric Pellegrini, Miguel Gonzalez, Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Tilo Seydel

### IN16B:

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Finish multiple load files
 * Energy channel cropping - do Lamp way
 * Discrepancies between Lamp and Mantid after loading IN16B data/vanadium
 * Vanadium calibration opitions

#### Gagik:

* Loading of new nexus files from IN16B now merged in Mantid
* Loading multiple files in Mantid currently waiting to be merged (some changes being made after review)
* Selecting multiple files in the reduction GUI started

#### Venrena:

* Errors very small after loading experimental data now
* Some discrepancies in the deltaX discretisation between Lamp and Mantid
* FindPeaks and FindEPP algorithms tested in Mantid - FindPeaks found to give a lot of flexibility
* Tilo suggested for the energy transfer we should check whether the Instrument->Doppler->incident_wavelength is given for sinusoidal-signals

* Work for next week:
 * Continue with multiple file selection
 * Look into revision of IndirectILLReduction workflow algorithm?
 * Investigate energy transfer incident wavelength
 * Make use of FindPeaks for each spectrum (not summed)

### ToF Spectroscopy:

#### IN4 (Antti):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Investigate why the current detector efficiency does what it does, also inverstigate He3TubeEfficiency in Mantid
 * Look at IN4 diffraction data supplied by Mark
 * Visual inspection of IN4 for detector configuration

* Detector efficiency correction now better understood, tries to choose energy convention automatically
* Convert units always uses the same energy convention for IN4/5/6, so use this for in DetectorEfficencyCorUser
* IN4 Instrument definition - a bug was found in Mantid while creating the small angle (Rosace) detector shapes - now fixed and merged

* Work for next week:
 * Enjoy holiday in Finland
 * Investigate and compare He3TubeEfficency and DetectorEfficiencyCorUser

#### IN6 (Ian):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Finish creation of updated IN6 Instrument Definition File â€“ and check understanding of detector positions (also to help with IN4 dataset)
 * IN6 comparison for other data sets
 * (Also try tidying up reduction script with Gagik's load changes for multiple files)

* New IDF for IN6 created with correct grouping of banks (an error was noted in the one shown in the slides with the angles being flipped)
* Comparison between new and old IDF appear to show a slight sharpening in the peaks for the data
* Applying the correction for the high angle detector appears to make a small improvement to the data

* Work for next week:
 * Meet with IN6 instrument scientists to verify IN6 IDF
 * Finish generalising IN6 IDF creation to help with IN4 update
 * IN6 comparison for other data sets
