## Meeting notes - 2017/02/07

Participants: Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Verena Reimund, Gagik Vardanyan, Miguel Gonzalez, Bjorn Fak, Paolo Mutti

### Antti - ToF Spectroscopy Progress Update

See the [presentation](2017-02-07-TOF.pdf) for more details.

Initial goals for the sprint were:
 * Fix most urgent issues in DirectILLReduction, open a pull request
 * Start serious work on GUI
 * Implement missing functionality

Progress:
 * `DirectILLReduction` is usable but a bit big
 * Algorithm split into chunks, for loading, detector diagnostics, self shielding, vanadium and reduction to S(q,&omega;)/S(&theta;,&omega;)
 * Flat background - to take care of background from electronics and cosmic background radiation
 * S(&theta;,&omega;) used for input to Horace, S(q,&omega;) otherwise
 * Density of States - Mantid calculates this from S(q,&omega;), not from S(&theta;,&omega;)
 * PM asked about dead time corrections - not currently performed but could be (after detecting a neutron there is a delay before another neutron can be detected - so the later neutron may appear in later time channel than it should)
 * Documentation - BF mentioned this is important to test the algorithms
  * Idea to make some top level documentation, possibly in the concepts area, and have the smaller algorithms point to this
 * MG asked about testing in IN5 and IN6
  * AS said this might be possible to test in a few weeks
 * BF asked about finding the EPP position for IN5 - should look at what ISIS do for LET, MARI etc.
 * Discussion about knowledge of pulse timings for IN4,5,6 - PM and BF talked about ways to improve this
 * IN6 detectors are not well placed  - Lamp shifts detector positions
 * IN5 detectors have some inclination - can determine this to correct for it - look at ARCS
 * EPP for IN4 - determining the peak works, but no peak for liquids
 * PM asked about performance comparison with LAMP
  * Not done yet, mostly important for IN5
  * BF feels that accuracy in Mantid is more important than performance over Lamp
  * Could use a reduced data set for a quick preview of reduction (e.g. just a call to `ExtractSpectra` with a suitable choice of spectra)

Bjorn's experience from testing:
 * Detector diagnostics is good - agrees with calculations done by hand
 * Problems with vanadium and the ToF axis
 * Question about how to define set of samples - possible to use a Python dictionary -see [`SetSample`](http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/algorithms/SetSample-v1.html)?

Work for next sprint:
 * Fix bugs introducded during the splitting up of the algorithm
 * Unit tests for separated algorithm
 * Documentation for the new algorithms
 * Design for GUI
 * Fix smaller issues:
  * Detector ID/Spectrum number mismatch
  * Remove properties no longer required
  * Make Debye-Waller correction optional for vanadium
 * Get Paalman-Pings self-shielding corrections working
