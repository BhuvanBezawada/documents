## Meeting notes - 2017/12/01 - Reflectometry meeting

Participants: Verena Reimund, Antti Soininen, Gagik Vardanyan, Miguel Gonzalez, Paolo Mutti, Franck Cecillon, Thomas Saerbeck, Remi Perenon, Richard Campbell, Philipp Gutfreund, Armando Maestro, Ian Bush

### Antti: Presentation of reduction workflow 

See [slides](2017-12-01-Reflectometry.pdf) for more details.

Initial goals:
 * Progress with implementation of polarization corrections
 * Progress with foreground summation in coherent case 
 * Have peak search and detector rotation as separate algorithms
 * Check origin of discrepancies between Mantid and Cosmos at large Q for 'dan' option and check behaviour for 'san' option.
 * Add water reference to workflow

Progress:
 * Figaro Loader
   * Improved Figaro loading in `LoadILLReflectometry`
   * Calculation of geometry done in Mantid - this information will be added to the NeXus files, but doing it in Mantid will support existing files
   * Horizontal offset of ~6 cm accounted for 
   * RC said that the detectors should face the sample even when offset like this
 * Simple Reduction Comparison
   * Cosmos vs Mantid - a small difference due to pixel centre being an integer value in Cosmos
   * Fixing this in Mantid shows a much closer comparison
   * Some discussion between RC and TS followed about which centre value to use when calculating Q, agreed that both ways of calculating would be preferable
   * MG - the way that Mantid works should be able to use average &theta;
 * Polarization Corrections
   * Can read ASCII file and create Mantid compatible workspace - `LoadILLPolaizationFactors`
   * Corrections can be applied
   * Next step is to implement the correction calculations
 
Work for next sprint:
 * Polarization corrections

### Verena: Gravity Corrections

Initial goals:
 * Check with real data from ISIS and/or ILL --> Figaro.
 * Complete Figaro loader. As updated NeXus files containing the requested new fields will not be available until next cycle, the loader will need to calculate them from existing fields.
 * Gravity corrections (design doc completed by VR)
 * Figaro loader ...

Progress:
 * Initial implementation of algorithm exists
 * Testing required
   * RC suggested some data sets that should be used - one for up and one down - numors to be sent to VR
   * PM mentioned there is some data from 2015 in NeXus files
 * PG mentioned about not rebinning too early
   * For coherent algorithm this should not be the case
   * Mentioned that 1D data is always rebinned anyway
 * VR - algorithm fairly straightforward, not too many input options

Work for next sprint:
 * Test gravity corrections
 * Produce something to test

Discussion on rollout for reflectometry:
 * PM - machines in mid-December, a chance to test
 * First cycle for commissioning
 * Get teste done
 * ASCII and Cosmos will still be there to test agiainst
 * MG - current limitation is GUI, power user only to start with
