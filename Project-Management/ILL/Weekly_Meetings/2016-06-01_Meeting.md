## Agenda - 2016/06/01

* Review of work done

## Meeting Notes - 2016/05/23

Present - Mark Johnson, Gagik Vardanyan, Vernea Reimund, Eric Pellegrini, Emmanuel Farhi, Miguel Gonzalez, Didier Richard, Antti Soininen, Ian Bush

* Mantid build on Mac (El Capitan) now works

### IN16 (Verena and Gagik)
* Comparison of simple QENS data reduction in LAMP and MANTID
* Summed spectra are identical
* Spectra from single and multi detectors are organised differently in LAMP and MANTID

### IN4 (Antti, Ian)
* Comparison of SQW data for IN4 (NeXus format data) in LAMP and MANTID
* (LAMP can now read/use ascii and NeXus files - Didier Richard/Stef Rols)
* Mantid data looks OK
* LAMP needs to be re-run using 'in4strip' and possibly 'sumbank' - these commands are not needed in MANTID

## Work for sprint cycle to 2016/0523

### IN16:
* Check individual detectors signals are identical - as well as total signal
* Mask unused single detectors
* Organise data in 2D plot in physically meaningful way e.g. by scattering angle
* Read and sum multiple runs correctly - use 'merge runs'?
* Perform more complete data reduction (vanadium normalisation, background subtraction,...)
* Treat mirror signals separately and see how to combine them
* Discuss data reduction with Thilo (Wednesday) - see how he uses or wants to use MANTID
* Treat elastic (and inelastic) scan data.

### IN4:
* Careful comparison of SQW data reduction in LAMP and MANTID for more than one set of data
* Compare Q-dependence of data (especially elastic signal) and energy dependence (data summed over Q and Q-slices)
* Include vanadium normalisation, empty can subtraction, absorption correction,...
* Calculate and compare GDOS (generalised density of states)
* Demonstrate progress/status to Bjorn on Friday or Monday
