## Meeting notes - 2017/03/09 - Feedback on ToF and Backscattering for PMC Meeting

Participants: Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Verena Reimund, Gagik Vardanyan, Paolo Mutti, Franck Cecillon, Tilo Seydel, Bjorn Fak, Miguel Gonzalez

### Gagik - Backscattering

See the [presentation](2017-03-09-Backscattering.pdf) for more details.

Changes based on feedback from MG:
 * Multiple file limit changed for ILL via `facilities.xml` - 100 not enough for FWS, now 1000
 * `MatchPeaks` - input validation for checking bins match
 * Mirror Sense for EFWS, files can be ambiguous, logic changed to check for empty wings
  * MG asked if this happened often. TS Not understood why it happens.
  * Possible to fix in Nomad?
 * Issue with graph scaling when using normalization option under investigation
 * More generally need to make sure users have access to relevant documentation. Concepts area of docs might be a good place for this.

New features required:
 * Convert spectrum axis to Q option
 * Subtract empty can from vandium - same as sample or different
 * Automatic QENS data reduction - give a list and decide what goes together
  * Requires grouping at the raw level, right after loading
  * Performance could be better as the reduction is run for fewer workspaces
  * Perhaps a new general purpose algorithm - `GroupBySampleLog`?
  * PM, FC - can add sample temperature averaged for time of acquisition and sigma. BF - min/max would be useful too. Not sure what is used for IN16B.
  * PM can do this from database from Nomad too.
  * AS - run `MergeRuns` in a loop?
 * Paalman Pings for FWS - refactoring work in progress by Spencer Howells and company.

### Tilo - Feedback

 * TS has been using Mantid for QENs - most people find it intuitive for plotting etc.
 * 5+ experiments been tested with no major issues.
 * Transfer to 2&theta; can lead to a crash. GV - crash should be prevented, can not fit a group workspace.
 * QENs unmirror 6 can be used when not wishing to apply mirror sense.
 * TS - always pathological cases! Continouts evolution expected with more options required in the future.
  * For sample scattering from sample for normalisation.

### Antti - ToF Spectroscopy

See the [presentation](2017-03-09-TOF.pdf) for more details.

Recent changes:
 * Splitting of monolithic algorithm - now in six parts
 * IN4, IN5 and IN6 all handled
  * IN5 requires some optimizations, to stop excessive memory use
  * Some outstanding issues that require use input
 * GUI prototype - Python bindings soon available for the DataProcessor widget
 * Basic documentation written - still requires some usage examples

Plans:
 * Self-shielding - possibly should wait for Pallaman-Pings corrections, being worked on by Spencer Howells, to mature
  * BF said that his is very important to data reduction
  * AS - we should get something working for now, even if performance is not yet as good as it could be
  * BF - need slab and annular geometries (slab has an analytic solution so not such a problem)

### Bjorn & Miguel - Feedback

 * MG - test for IN5 and IN6 seem reasonably good.
 * BF - recent test looks good qualitative, need quantitative testing against known results (e.g. LAMP)
 * MantidPlot - difficulty getting plots out
  * Slice mode as Mantid algorithm
  * Too much click currently, need scripts to plot
