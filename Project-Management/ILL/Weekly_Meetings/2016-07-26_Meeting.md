## Meeting notes - 2016/07/27

Participants: Gagik Vardanyan, Miguel Gonzalez, Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Bjorn Fak, Eric Pellegrini

### IN16B:

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Start to finalise workflow - discuss further with MG Monday afternoon
 * Generalisation of FindEPP - move category
 * ShiftCircular - need to determine if this is really needed and implement

#### Gagik:

* Difficulties combining the merge unmirror/calibration with the multiple file treatment
 * Option 0 - done
 * Option 1-3 in progress
 * Other options work in progress
* IndirectCalibration and FindEPP not committed
* Fixed Window Scans designed, need to be implemented

* Work for next week:
 * Continue with resolving the merger unmirror/calibration for multiple files
 * Work on Fixed Window Scans

### ToF Spectroscopy:


#### IN6 (Ian):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Get confirmation on IN6 IDF and detector efficiencies
 * Discrepancies in two points for IN6 S(phi,E) plot
 * ToF workflow

* IN6 monitors now correct in the IDF, IDF appears complete
* L1 values to use for IN6 - was agreed to use distance to Fermi chopper, this has the most physical meaning
* S(phi,E) problems from last week were due to incorrect masking, agreement now similar to that seen in IN4
* [`MergeRuns` extension](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/16928) - in progress

* Work for next week:
 * Finish `MergeRuns` extension
 * Merge IN6 IDF changes
 * Look into IN6 detector efficiency further
 * ToF Workflow Algorithm

#### IN4 (Antti):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Decide on ToF data reduction workflow
 * IDF - wide angle detector grouping, revise rosace
 * Absorption correction algorithms

* `DetectorEfficiencyCorUser` merged to master after some conflicts
* Ticket for `GetEiMonDet` version 2 (agreed with Andrei this can be replaced, version 1 currently unused)
* ToF workflow `DGSReduction` vs MLZ solution - MLZ will be more in line with our needs, have similar plans for spreadsheet interface for multiple runs, will mean workflow in Python
* Decision made to go with MLZ solution, need to meet with them to discuss further

* Work for next week:
 * Document IN4 IDF
 * Implementation of `GetEiMonDet`
