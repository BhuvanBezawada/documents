## Backscattering

## Meeting notes - 2016/12/12

Participants: Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Verena Reimund, Gagik Vardanyan, Tilo Seydel

### Analysis for Backscattering

Initial goals for the sprint were:
 * Implement Sum/Interpolate options for empty can and vanadium in FWS
   * Interpolation machinery is ready - done
   * Cubic splines provided by SplineInterpolation for simple cases -done
   * Difficulties with corner cases (2 points, more points then in sample runs)
   * Extrapolation can only be flat, and requires x-axis to be sorted
 * Complete 2 system tests, for QENS and FWS with updated reference histograms
 * Find a nice way to convert time-stamp-like string-type sample log to a numeric value

Current work:
* A few differences between IN16B and (OS)IRIS data prevented the direct use of reduction algorithms
* Aim to make these compatible with minimal intervention to the analysis routines and interfaces
* ISIS approach:
 * Full data treament is run in steps behind different tabs in the GUI
 * One algorithm behinnd each tab
 * Usually done left-to-right, can also run as a Python script
 * Tabs for reduction, vanadium, container subtraction and the analysis
 * Workspaces/filenames have suffix describing what it contains
* Some difference between reducded data formats such as y-axis, workspace/filename suffix, use of workspace groups on when the can subtraction is done
 * TS - preferable to keep the y-axis as 2&theta;, asked about option to output both
 * Agreed on option to output both from reduction algorithm
 * Other changes such as filename suffix would not be a problem
 * The y-axis being spectrum number, as per the ISIS approach, also has the downside that the single detectors will be at the top (difficult to change as the number of them varies)
 * TS - should not need grouping of workspaces, as usually working sample-by-sample, so preventing use of group workspaces makes sense
* Corrections GUI at ISIS
 * This should be useful for Paalaman-Pings corrections, and has a nice tool for visualisation
 * Problem if the container subtraction sends the counts negative when plotting on a log scale
* Resolution files
 * For ISIS these are the vanadium with summed spectra
 * TS - this is Q dependent for IN16B, so would rather have fitted vanadium
 * This can be neglected for the PSDs, but not for small angle detectors

Work for next sprint:
 * Work on compatibility with absorption corrections
 * Skype with Louise and Spencer from ISIS to discuss analysis
 * Get PR for the workflow algorithms merged - possibility to get help from ISIS
 * Next cycle starts on January 19th - aim to have an update for them
 * TS will be able to test analysis routines against Matlab scripts
