## Meeting notes - 2016/08/30

Participants: Gagik Vardanyan, Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Verena Reimund, Bjorn Fak, Mark Johnson, Miguel Gonzalez, Tilo Seydel 

### ToF Spectroscopy:

#### IN4 (Antti):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * `DetectorEfficiencyCorUser` extension

* Updates to IN4 IDF based on information provided by BF - correction to phi bank angles
* `GetEiMonDet` merged into Mantid
 * Also received information on calculating which frame the monitor peak arrived in for IN4
* Started improvements to `DetectorEfficiencyCorUser`
 * BF still looking at efficiency corrections
* ToF Data Reduction workflow
 * MLZ have a pull request for their data reduction GUI
 * Need to re-evaluate options based on this

* Work for next week:
 * `GetEiMonDet` work continues
 * Look into MLZ data reduction further

#### IN6 (Ian):

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Work on `MergeRuns`
 * Holiday

* Work continued on MergeRuns
* Overriding defaults from Instrument Parameter File to be done on `MergeRuns` algorithm

* Work for next week:
 * MergeRuns
  * Time Series data
  * `MergeRuns` extra arguments

### IN16B:

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * Catch up with Tilo, demo of GUI and check about calibration questions
 * GV - GUI Controller
 * GV - Detector angle as y-axis in QENS reduction
 * GV - Background subtraction in QENS reduction
 * GV - Change all to MultipleFile (i.e. calibration, vanadium and background)
 * VR - 1 Fixed Window Scan reduction
 * VR - 2 Fix calibration workspace declaration and usage
 * VR - 3 (MaskBins -> maks bins according to bin number, MatchPeakPosition -> new algorithm)
 * VR - 4 Start reviewing PRs

* GV gave a demo of the IN16B reduction GUI for Tilo's benefit
* Added background subtraction both in the algorithm and GUI
 * TS - In the GUI a one-to-one subtraction is fine for most cases, advanced cases via script may require empty can, non one-to-one options, possibility to have another tab for background subtraction with more options
 * Correction factors for sample may be required
 * As may require corrections outside GUI background subtraction should accept a workspace
* Some discussion about files and workspaces for Background, Vanadium and Calibration
 * Issues with this due to multiple file property being mandatory in Mantid
* Calibration workspace properties
* Mirror sense now read form NeXus file
* Work on algorithm for MatchPeakPositions
* Some merge conflict issues
* Work on some comparisons with Lamp (to be shown next week)

* Work for next week:
 * More tests for ILLReduction
 * VR: `MatchPeakPosition` tests for class
 * VR: Start fixed window scan implementation
 * VR: Make a release with CPack
 * GV: Slight modification of `SelectNexusFilesByMetadata` to not to alter the input algebra
 * GV: Implement all properties of `MWRunFiles` GUI widget to `DataSelector` widget (multiple files, etc.)
 * GV: Investigate the possibility of allowing a `MultipleFileProperty` to be optional
 * GV: Make all the auxiliary files (background,vanadium,calibration) also to allow multiple files
 * GV: Move plot and save from python to GUI
 * GV: Treat the calibration file case
 * GV: Get rid of check_QENS method and call `SelectNexusFilesByMetadata` before the loading instead
 * IDF for IN16B

### Other discussion:

* MJ to ask computing about a VM for IN16B, so we can keep a test version available for TS (currently using VR's machine!)
* Next meeting at 11 am Tuesday 06/09/16 to avoid clash with SINE2020 meeting (TS unable to attend)
