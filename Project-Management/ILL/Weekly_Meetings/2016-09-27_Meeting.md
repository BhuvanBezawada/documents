Participants: Antti Soininen, Ian Bush, Verena Reimund, Miguel Gonzalez, Bjorn Fak, Eric Pellegrini, Tilo Seydel, Gagik Vardanyan 

### ToF Spectroscopy:

#### Antti:

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * `WorkflowAlgorithmRunner` testing, etc.
 * Algorithms for TOF workflow, e.g. flat background

* WorkflowAlgorithmRunner PR reviewed and ready to ship
* Reviewed a pull request for masking workspaces with grouped spectra
* Deutsche Neutronenstreutagung conference - talked to Marina Ganeva about vanadium correction
* `CalculateFlatBackground` - some issues at edges
 * BF mentioned that it should be cyclic, this will get rid of noise seen in first and last ToF channels
* `ComputeCalibrationCoefVan`
 * Better approximations are not continuous
 * AS and BF mentioned possibility to get experimental data

* Work for next week:
 * `AutoRebin` - to do the requested automatic rebinning
 * Fix issues with Python/C++ types for `GetEiMonDet`

#### Ian:

* Ian mentioned GitHub projects for keeping track of work to be done

* Initial goals for the week were:
 * `MergeRuns` for a single workspace
 * ToF workflow test
   * Test for IN6
   * `GetEiMonDet` parameter calculated in load
   * Documentation, test refactoring
 
* Spent some time over last sprint getting open PRs fixed/ready to be merged - all of these made 3.8
* Some testing and minor bug fixes for ToF workflow
 * `MergeRuns` and `ExtractMonitors` are now available to use in the workflow

* Work for next week:
 * ToF workflow
   * `GetEiMonDet` paramaeter calculation in load
   * Documentation, test, refactoring
 * NoBugs talk
 * Design document for scanning instruments
   * BF mentioned FlatCone also having this requirement

### IN16B:

#### Verena/Gagik:

Initial goals for the week:
 * Finish outstanding work for `MatchPeaks`, create PR
 * Begin FixedWindowScan design and implementation

* Some manual testing for mantid nightly
* `FindEPP` with multiprocessing runs still needs fixes
* `MatchPeaks` release notes done, PR open
* `IndirectILLFixedWindowScans` issue created, work underway
 * MG - could require vanadium etc. for FWS
* Published a copy of `IndirectILLReduction` and `IndirectILLFixedWindowScans` on `/users/Mantid/bin/MantidPlot`
 * This may need checking and fixing - VR to let TS know when it is ready again
 * Look at running this on IN16B machine or VM from help desk

* Work for next week:
 * VR - check build for TS to test
 * VR - fixed window scans workflow
 * GV - work on system tests for `IndirectILLReduction`
   * Question about one/many tests for mirror modes
   * Suggested to use most complex option, and possibly one or two others
