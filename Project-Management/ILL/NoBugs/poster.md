### Data Reduction at the ILL: A Comparison Between Mantid and Lamp

#### Antti Soininen, Gagik Vardanyan, Ian Bush, Verena Reimund

At the ILL Mantid is being introduced for neutron data reduction, with a view to eventually replace the existing Lamp software. We present some work discussing the differences and similarities in approach between Lamp and Mantid, and a comparison of data reduction treatments for Time-of-Flight Spectroscopy and Backscattering data. We will also discuss some of the changes required in Mantid to allow like-for-like comparisons to be made.

At the ILL Mantid is being introduced for neutron data reduction and analysis, with a view to eventually replace the existing Lamp software. We discuss some of the general differences and similarities between the technologies and approaches adopted therein. More detailed comparison of data reduction treatments for Time-of-Flight Spectroscopy and Backscattering data is presented. Few adjustments required in Mantid to allow like-for-like comparisons with Lamp is also summarised.
