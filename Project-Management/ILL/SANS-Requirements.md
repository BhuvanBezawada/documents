## SANS Requirements

Original requirements documents:
 * [SANS discussion](SANS/Bastille_SANS_Discussion_Doc_250315.pdf)
 * [SANS discussion notes](SANS/Bastille_SANS_Discussion_Notes_250315.pdf)
 * [Time-of-flight data reduction explanation](SANS/SANS_DirkHonnecker.pdf)

Could be that work done for HFIR at the SNS is most relevant - another reactor. Mathieu Doucet at the SNS knows most about this approach. For general information on SANS reduction in Mantid see [this document](http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/algorithms/SANSReduction-v1.html).

The SANS reduction works somewhat differently to [Time of Flight Spectroscopy](Time-of-Flight-Spectroscopy-Requirements.md), as every step is called within the workflow algorithm. For example, for D33 the two algorithms required for the initial reduction are [SetupILLD33Reduction](http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/algorithms/SetupILLD33Reduction-v1.html) and [SANSReduction](http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/algorithms/SANSReduction-v1.html).

Normally the algorithms listed below would not be called individually. However, for the purposes of comparing Lamp and Mantid they should be useful to be scripted separately. In the report by Wilcke some differences were noted between Lamp and Mantid, so the reduction steps will need to be broken down to determine where the differences occur.

An example of a D33 reduction script can be seen [here](https://www.ill.eu/fileadmin/users_files/documents/instruments_and_support/support_facilities/computing_for_science/data_analysis/process_data_final.py).

Note, in addition to Lamp another program is available from the ILL, [GRASP](https://www.ill.eu/fr/instruments-support/instruments-groups/groups/lss/grasp/home/). This is Matlab based, and was found by Wilcke to give somewhat similar results to Lamp, but with more noise in the results.

### Interfaces

There are two interfaces available for SANS reduction, one is for ISIS and one for ORNL (HFIR/SNS). Lamp has a different approach, an editable spreadsheet showing all of the input data together. This may be desired in Mantid, so a decision will need to be made on using this against using the existing SANS reduction interfaces.

### SANS Requirements

1. Verify loaders are still compatible with current data
1. Compare beam centre finding algorithms
1. Compare transmission corrections
1. Investigate requirements for detector dead time calculations
1. Compare sans_cor in Lamp with the following in Mantid:
 * SANSSolidAngleCorrection
 * NormaliseByThickness
 * SANSAbsoluteScale
1. Compare radial integration between Mantid and Lamp
1. Find or create a Mantid equivalent to sans_merge
1. Finalise workflows for:
 * D33
 * D11
 * D22
1. Interface
 * Determine requirements for interface, create mockups
 * Implement interface, making as much use of existing ISIS and ORNL interfaces as possible
