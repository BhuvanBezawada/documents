Mantid Training ILL, 8/9 Feb, 2018
----------------------------------

General

* How to set data search directory to InternalUse without having access? (e.g. for calibration file)
* Load and subtract
* 3D plots are ugly
* Default plot ranges are crazy (e.g. 50912.123095 - 60941.549320)
* Plot Bin not easily accessible (e.g. right click)
* No way to plot the sum of few spectra directly
* Mac window behaviour is odd
* Mac package signing (check with Samuel Jackson)
* IN4LNX - hangs on shutdown, to investigate
* D20 and IN16B are unstable on Ian's Windows PC for nightly and unstable buidls
* Windows fails to show results log when more than one copy of MantidPlot is open

Powder Diffraction Session:

* Fullprof buffer file
* Numor names in Fullprof exports
* SortXAxis support also descending
* ~~Easily mutable spectrum axis in python~~

Backscattering:

* Manually specify the integration range for IFWS
* Easy way to set X sections (method shown by Antti in ToF part)
* Calibration scaling in FWS
* What about BATS mode?

TOF:

* Show percentage of masked pixels in the report
