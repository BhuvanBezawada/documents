# D20 Definition

This document describes the definition of D20 powder diffraction instrument at ILL.
The full instrument description can be found at 
[D20 paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-0233/19/3/034001/pdf "Title") and [D20 summary](https://www.ill.eu/instruments-support/instruments-groups/instruments/d20/description/instrument-layout/)

## Coordinate system

The global coordinate system used is the Mantid-default right-handed system: `z` axis is in the incoming beam direction while `y` axis points up. 

## Source

The monochromator, situated at `z = -3.2m`, is defined as the beam source. 

## Monitor

There is one monitor present, situated at `z = -2.0m` with cuboid shape.

## Sample

Sample is located at the origin of the global coordinate system.

## Detector

The entire detector is composed of `48` flat plates, placed in a polygonal arrangement at `1.471m` from sample to the mid-point of the surface of the detector plate. All the plates are perpendicular to the scattering plane (`zx`) and are facing the sample. Each plate is modeled as a composition of `32` cuboid shaped cells with height of `0.15m` and depth of `0.05m`. Cell width is `0.002568m` such that it covers approximately *0.1&deg;* in scattering angle. The overall coverage of the detector is `48 * 32 * 0.1` *= 153.6&deg;*.

## Cell splitting

Each cell can be virtually split into 2 or 3 by DAQ, by deducing the part of the cell that the neutron was more likely to hit.
Therefore in Mantid, 3 alternative instrument definitions are created, so that they can be loaded correpondingly to the splitting configuration:

- D20_lr (low resolution): This is the physical configuration, i.e. `32` cells of widht `0.002568m`.

- D20 : Cells are split to 2; `64` cells of widht `0.001284m`. This is the nominal configuration.

- D20_hr (high resolution) : Cells are split to 3; `96` cells of width `0.000856m`.

## Initial position

D20 is a moving instrument and can be rotated around `y` axis to cover different *2&theta;* range. Initially it is placed such that it covers *0 < 2&theta; < 153.6&deg;*. 

## Instrument view

Below is the view of the instrument in Mantid. Blue is the z-axis pointing to the direction of the incoming beam. Green is the y-axis point to top. Red is the x-axis of the right-handed coordinate system.
