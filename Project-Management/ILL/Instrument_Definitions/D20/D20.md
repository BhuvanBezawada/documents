# D20 Definition

This document describes the definition of D20 powder diffraction instrument at ILL.
The full instrument description can be found at 
[D20 paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-0233/19/3/034001/pdf "Title") and [D20 summary](https://www.ill.eu/instruments-support/instruments-groups/instruments/d20/description/instrument-layout/)

## Coordinate system

The global coordinate system used is the Mantid-default right-handed system: `z` axis is in the incoming beam direction while `y` axis points up. 

## Source

The monochromator, situated at `z = -3.2m`, is defined as the beam source. 

## Monitor

There is one monitor present, situated at ... with the shape of ....

## Sample

Sample is located at the origin of the global coordinate system.

## Detector

The entire detector is composed of `48` flat plates, placed in a polygonal arrangement at `1.471m` from sample to the mid-point of the surface of the detector plate. All the plates are perpendicular to the scattering plane (`zx`) and are facing the sample. Each plate is modeled as a composition of `32` cuboid shaped cells with height of `0.15m` and depth of `0.05m`. Cell width is `0.002568m` such that it covers approximately `0.1 degree` in scattering angle. The overall coverage of the detector is `48 * 32 * 0.1 = 153.6 degree`.

## Initial position

D20 is a moving instrument and can be rotated around `y` axis to cover different `2theta` range. Initially it is placed such that it covers `0 < 2theta < 153.6 degrees`. 

## Instrument view

Below is the view of the instrument in Mantid. Blue is the z-axis pointing to the direction of the incoming beam. Green is the y-axis point to top. Red is the x-axis of the right-handed coordinate system.
