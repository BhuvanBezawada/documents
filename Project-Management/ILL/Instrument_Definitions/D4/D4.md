# D4 Definition

This document describes the definition of D4 powder diffraction instrument at ILL.
The full instrument description can be found at 
[D4 paper](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003390101087 "Title") and [D4 summary](https://www.ill.eu/instruments-support/instruments-groups/instruments/d4/description/instrument-layout/)

## Coordinate system

The global coordinate system used is the Mantid-default right-handed system: `z` axis is in the incoming beam direction while `y` axis points up. 

## Source

The monochromator, situated at `z = -??m`, is defined as the beam source. 

## Monitor

There is one monitor present, situated at ... with the shape of ....

## Sample

Sample is located at the origin of the global coordinate system.

## Detector

The entire detector is composed of `9` flat panels, placed in a polygonal arrangement at `1.146m` from sample to the mid-point of the surface of the detector plate. All the plates are perpendicular to the scattering plane (`zx`) and are facing the sample. Each plate covers `8 degree` in *2&theta;* and there is a gap of `7 degree` between neighbouring panels. Each panel is composed of `64` cuboid shaped cells with height of `0.1m` and width of `0.0025m`. Each cell covers approximately `0.125 degree` in scattering angle. 

## Cell splitting

D4 cells can be virtaully split by 2 by DAQ, deducing which part of the cell the neutron was more likely to hit. Therefore in Mantid, 2 alternative geometries are created:

- D4a is the nominal (physical) configuration
- D4b has cells split by 2, i.e. `128` cells with width of `0.00125m` in each plate.

## Initial position

D4 is a scanning instrument and is rotated around `y` axis to cover more complete *2&theta;* range. Initially it is placed such that it covers *2&theta; > 1.5* degrees. 

## Instrument view

Below is the view of the instrument in Mantid. Blue is the z-axis along the direction of the incoming beam. Green is the y-axis point to top. Red is the x-axis of the right-handed coordinate system.
