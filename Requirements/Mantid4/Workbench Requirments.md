## Lessons from Mantidplot
Mantidplot has been in use for 8-9 years now and has grown significantly in functionality and complexity from it's origins as a fork of QtiPlot.  We have gathered a lot of feedback on Mantidplot over the years, and there are several valuable lessons to be learned from that interface.

1. We have trained a lot of users in the current ways of doing things in Mantidplot, radical changes would require a lot of retraining.
1. The MDI (multiple document interface) approach of Mantidplot is watefull of screen space and is generally not liked.  We have worked around this by making windows float, but this adds to complexity.
1. Users frequently complain about the number of toolbar buttons and menu items,  having toolbars and buttons local to where they apply (like on graph windows) will make things much clearer.
1. We have two main groups of users, GUI only users and users that are more interested in scripting (this is often still within the GUI).
