At the ILL LAMP (Large Array Manipulation Program) [1] has been the primary package responsible for data reduction for over 20 years. LAMP is based on IDL, so works across multiple platforms, and provides a graphical user interface and scripting capabilities for data treatment. It provides support for all of the instruments at ILL, having the ability to handle data produced at the ILL since its creation. In order to facilitate ease of use and the standardisation of neutron data reduction software across many facilities worldwide, a decision has been made to phase out LAMP and bring in Mantid [2] as the main tool for the data treatment.

The Mantid Framework is a cross-platform and easy-to-extend package providing both GUI and python scripting capabilities for complex data manipulation. Mantid has been in use for some time at ISIS and the SNS, and the ESS will also use it for all data reduction. A number of advantages are foreseen in adopting Mantid, such as well established distributed development practices, and the presence of much of the data reduction functionality that exists in LAMP. In addition, it will also provide a more consistent user experience for users undertaking experiments at different facilities. Within the Mantid Project, there are many example of collaborative sub-projects, which have allowed allowing several facilities to contribute to, and benefit from combined effort.

The current Mantid adoption project started in May 2016 at the ILL, and builds on previous work undertaken during a project to explore using Mantid in principle. The 3-year long project involves a team of 3 new developers, plus a developer for one year with existing Mantid experience, under the Computing for Science Group at the ILL. The objective is to provide a smooth transition from LAMP to Mantid by providing Mantid support for most of the instruments at the ILL by the end of the project.

In this talk we will present the progress made thus far in using Mantid on Time-of-Flight spectroscopy (IN4, IN5 and IN6) and Backscattering (IN16B) instruments at the ILL. We will discuss some of the differences in approach between LAMP and Mantid and the challenges faced along the way. We will also share the future plans for the project to address the other technique areas used at the ILL, and to support instruments with moving detectors at the ILL.

At the ILL LAMP (Large Array Manipulation Program) [1] has been the primary package responsible for data reduction for over 20 years. Despite handling the data produced at the ILL since its creation, it is less viable nowadays due to being based on technologies, like IDL, unfamiliar to modern users, and limited capabilities to accommodate growing needs by the scientific community. In order to facilitate ease of use and the standardisation of neutron data reduction software across many facilities worldwide, a decision has been made to phase out LAMP and bring in Mantid [2] as the main tool for the upcoming data treatment. Extensively used at the ISIS, SNS and recently ESS, it will soon become the standard at ILL.

The Mantid Framework is a cross-platform and easy-to-extend package providing both GUI and python scripting capabilities for complex data manipulation. A number of advantages are foreseen in adopting Mantid, both from the perspective of well established distributed development practices, as well as powerful data reduction facilities far beyond LAMP. In addition, it will foster user mobility by providing more consistent user experience for those undertaking experiments at different facilities. 

The current Mantid adoption project at ILL launched in May 2016, and is based on the effort undertaken during the previous project of exploration of using Mantid in principle. The 3-year long project involves a team of 3 new developers  plus a developer for one year with existing Mantid experience, under the Computing for Science Group at the ILL. The objective is to enable smooth transition from LAMP to Mantid by providing support for most of the instruments and reduction logic at the ILL in Mantid software.

In this talk we will present the progress made thus far in this area.  We will focus mostly on Time-of-Flight (IN4, IN5 and IN6) and Backscattering (IN16B) spectroscopy instruments at the ILL. We will discuss some of the differences in approaches between LAMP and Mantid and the challenges faced along the way. We will also share the future plans to address the other technique areas and to support instruments with moving detectors at the ILL.

##### Original (Ian)

A new team from the ILL has joined the Mantid project, building on work already undertaken to support instruments at the ILL. We will discuss the progress made in these areas, Mantid adoption on instruments and the challenges of adding a new distributed development team to the Mantid project. We will also discuss some of the future challenges that will need to be addressed for adoption of Mantid at the ILL.

##### Original (Gagik)

A new team at the ILL has joined the Mantid project, with the objective to fully implement ILL instruments support into Mantid. We present the progress made in these area, with the focus on the domains of TOF and Backscattering data reduction. Some future challenges that will need to be addressed for commisioning of Mantid at the ILL are also discussed.
