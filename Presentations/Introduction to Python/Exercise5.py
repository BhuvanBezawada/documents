## Exercise 5
#   1.  Build a list containing the 5 filenames of the text files that are going to be used.
#       (Hint: Can be done by hand or using the os.listdir() function in the os module)
#   2. Add a bogus file name that doesn't exist to the list (so that we have to do some error handling)
#   3. Loop over the list and for each file (Remember here that we have a non existent file in the list and calling open
#      on this will result in an IOError exception that needs to be dealt with)
#         1. Open the file;
#         2. Loop over each line;
#         3. Split the line up into sections (Hint: The string has a .split() function that splits the string on
#            whitespace and gives back a list with each section as an element of the list)
#         4. Convert the second column value into an integer
#         5. Keep track of the values for each line and compute an average for the file. 
#   4. Finally, print out a list of file,average-value pairs
