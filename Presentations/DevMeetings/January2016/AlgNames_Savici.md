# 1. Conventions

* Names no longer than 20 characters
* No underscores or spaces, only letters and numbers
* Start each word with a capital letter
* Numbers are allowed, after first character 
* "If possible, avoid abbreviations unless they are common and well understood."
* Standard prefixes for common tasks: [http://www.mantidproject.org/Mantid_Standards#Naming] (http://www.mantidproject.org/Mantid_Standards#Naming)

---

# 2. Inconsistent capitalization and abbreviations

* REFLReprocess and RefLReduction
* TOFSANSResolution, ConvertEmptyToTof, EQSANSMonitorTOF, EQSANSTofStructure
* DNSFlippingRatioCorr, DetectorEfficiencyCor, CylinderPaalmanPingsCorrection
* AsymmetryCalc, SpecularReflectionCalculateTheta
* ConvertDiffCal, ConvertToDiffractionMDWorkspace

---

# 3. Incomplete names

* Technique specific algorithms:

** CalculateResolution (Reflectometry only)
** ComputeSensitivity, IQTransform, Q1D (SANS)
** RemoveLowResTOF (Powder Diffraction)
** ModeratorTero (Indirect)

--

* Cannot tell if some algorithms just generate some correction or apply it

** AnnularRingAbsorption
** AnvredCorrection

---

# 4. Going into extreme - nonsensical names - does much more than the title impplies, or completely unexpected things

* What does MolDyn do? - check if it fails to plot in a non MantidPlot environment
* QLines, Quest
* ResNorm
* TimeSlice

---

# 5. Inconsistent use of the same word

* What does Calculate... do?

--

** CalculateEfficiency returns a workspace with efficiency

--

** CalculateFlatBackground subtracts a constant

--

** CalculateGammaBackground does both

---

# 6. Multiple word choices to indicate the same action

* Load/ Import (2)
* Get/ Calculate (16)/ Find (15)
* Generate/ Create (25)/ Fake (3)/ Predict (2)
