# 1. Motivation

* Fitting: core, essential for several scientific areas

* Hot topic (SSC)

* Issues: convergence, platform dependency, usability

* Test goodnes of fit and performance of fitting (focused on the Fit algorithm)?

* Project around least squares fitting, ISIS - [Numerical Analysis Group](http://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/SCD/organisation/42436.aspx?d=Numerical%20Analysis/), Scientific Computing Department, STFC.

# 2. Aim

* Not trying to solve the problem, but understand

* Collect datasets, benchmark

* Diverse coverage, problems from different:
  - devs
  - areas / instruments
  - facilities

* Fitting well isolated from other steps in the reduction/analysis workflows

# 3. System and Performance tests

* System test: [WeightedLeastSquaresTest](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/master/Testing/SystemTests/tests/analysis/WeightedLeastSquaresTest.py)
  - looking at accuracy
  - => extend the test with additional datasets or send them to us

* Performance: [CurveFittingTest](http://builds.mantidproject.org/view/All/job/master_performancetests/Master_branch_performance_tests/)
  - looking at speed

# 4. Reliability of fit

Did you know?

* Algorithm [CalculateChiSquared](http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/algorithms/CalculateChiSquared-v1.html)
  - Calculate the squared errors (different variants)
  - Explore errors in the neighborhood of the minima

# 5. Call for datasets

* Required: data to fit, function with initial values, brief explanation 

* **Your chance to have your favorite instrument/technique represented for future comparisons**
