## 1. Motivation

* Fitting: core, essential for several scientific areas

* Hot topic (SSC)

* Issues: convergence, platform dependency, usability

* Test goodnes of fit and performance of fitting (focused on the Fit algorithm)?

* Project around least squares fitting, ISIS - [Numerical Analysis Group](http://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/SCD/organisation/42436.aspx?d=Numerical%20Analysis/), Scientific Computing Department, STFC.

## 2. Aim

* Not trying to solve the problem, but understand

* Collect datasets, benchmark

* Diverse coverage, problems from different:
  - devs
  - areas / instruments
  - facilities

* Fitting well isolated from other steps in the reduction/analysis workflows
