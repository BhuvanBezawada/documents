# Tiling Window Managers

## Warning

- If you use Windows or OS X as your main OS I am probably
  about to waste your time

## Disclaimer

- Claims I make about windowed window managers are based on
  occasional use of:
    - Windows 10
    - Unity
    - LXDE

## Windowed window managers

- Program runs in a floating window

- Windows can be resized

- Windows can stack

- Windows can be positioned at will

## What's wrong with that?

- Poor use of screen real estate
    - Windows on top of each other
    - Empty space between/around windows

- Context switching overhead
    - Switch from one set of windows without disrupting layout

- Window layout overhead
    - Having to manually place more than two windows

- Some can be resource hogs
    - (I'm looking at you Unity...)

## So what's a tiling window manager?

- Full screen area is always used by default

- Layout is handled (mostly) automatically by layout engine
    - You define where windows should be relative to each other
    - The WM makes it happen

- Blazingly fast context (workspace) switching
    - Most allow many independent desktops/workspaces

## But why is that better?

- It fixes all the things I claim are wrong with windowed WMs

- Demo
    - i3 (https://i3wm.org)

- Multi-monitor workstations become a little pointless

## But...?

- Doesn't that take a lot of getting used to?
    - Yes, but it is definitely worth it

- It looks like a pain
    - It does, see above
      However this isn't for everyone

- Can I still have floating windows?
    - If you *really* want them
