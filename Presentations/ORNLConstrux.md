# Suggestions based on course at ORNL

**Context**

ORNL hired [Construx](http://www.construx.com/) to provide training December 1-3, 2015 on the topic of "Software Development Best Practices"

---

# What was covered (skipping lots)

1. Design by contract
2. "Better" coding standards
3. Write for others

---

# Design by contract

* Most bugs come from symantic errors rather than syntax errors
* Be explicit about what is expected of inputs and what will be provided by outputs
* Specify the contract in the code
* Make the names (objects, functions, variables) follow the contract

---

# Design by contract - doxygen [pre](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/commands.html#cmdpre) and [post](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/commands.html#cmdpost)

```c++
/**
 * \param x Bin boundaries to convert to. This vector will be copied
 * into this.
 * \pre The x-values will be in increasing order
 * \post The data will be correctly rebined or have thrown an exception
 */
void rebin(std::vector<double> x);
```
* Advantages:
  * Puts the contract next to the rest of the code documentation
  * Uses existing tags
* Disavantages:
  * Expects that people read the code before calling it

---

# Design by contract - [assert](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/assert) and 

```c++
#include <cassert>

void rebin(std::vector<double> x) {
  assert(std::is_sorted(x);
  // do the rebinning
  assert(this->y.size() == (x.size() + 1));
}
```
* Advantages:
  * Enforces the contract at runtime
  * Assertions only apply to debug builds (which is supported by CMake)
* Disadvantages:
  * Calculating assertions can be as expensive as just enforcing them ([sort](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/sort) vs [is_sorted](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/is_sorted))

# Make the names follow the contract

* Read [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882?keywords=code%20complete&qid=1450118105&ref_=sr_1_2&s=books&sr=1-2) by Robert “Uncle Bob” Martin
* [The Boy Scout Rule](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule): Leave the code better than you found it
