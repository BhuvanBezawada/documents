# Introducing a recovery function

## Motivation

Several users have commented that it would be very useful if Mantid could recover the final state after a crash. The motivation for this is quite clear. However, there are also some additional benefits that could arise from such a functionality.
* The history used for recovery could provide useful diagnostics of crash instances
* The history used for recovery could also be used to re-load workflows, rather than saving data, which is quicker for data-intensive users, such as single crystal diffraction

## Requirements

The recovery function should generate a script, this should:
* Be capable of recreating all workspaces present when it was last generated
* Be automatically generated at regular intervals
* Result in as efficient a re-load process as possible
* Have minimal overhead for running
* Allow some level of user choice of how much of the history to re-run

## Implementation possibilities

Currently the preferred option is to have a script that can amalgamate the workspace histories in the current instance of Mantid and generate a single script. This can be done by comparing time/date-stamps, algorithm names and input parameters.

### Notes/considerations

In sequential fitting algoritms may run with the same timestamp, but have different outputs. This suggests that string comparison as well as timestamp comparison will be necessary.

Workspace history will not delete workspaces that might have been deleted during the uptime. This could become an issue if there are a lot of these.

If a workspace is a memeber of a grouped workspace and another member of that group has been deleted, the original group workspace command will fail, as there is no record of all workspaces in the group. This is realted to `ADSValidator`.

Places where `ADSValidator` occurs:
* `Framework/Algorithms/src/DeleteWorkspaces.cpp`
* `Framework/Algorithms/src/GroupWorkspaces.cpp`
* `Framework/Muon/src/ConvertFitFunctionForMuonTFAsymmetry.cpp`
* `Framework/Algorithms/src/Stitch1DMany.cpp`
* `Framework/Algorithms/src/SumOverlappingTubes.cpp`
* `Framework/Algorithms/src/ConjoinXRuns.cpp`
* `Framework/WorkflowAlgorithms/src/ExtractQENSMembers.cpp`
* `Framework/Algorithms/src/MergeRuns.cpp`
* `Framework/Algorithms/src/PolarizationEfficiencyCor.cpp`

Check how `ConjoinWorkspaces` deals with history.

Certain actions performed in instrument view require a new workspace to be created before the algorithm can be executed. An example of this is `AddPeak`, in instrument view this creates a new peak workspace behind the scnenes, but this is not captured in the workspace history. As a result the script does not work properly when re-run. This can be re-created by running the unscripted diffraction test number 1 (ask Keith about this test if unsure).

## Open questions

* How much overlap would this functionality have with Project Saving? 
* Should the functionality be in MantidPlot or Framework?
  * It probably makes sense to have the workspace recovery fn available within the framework, while the ui elements can only be in the ui.  We would need to be able to disable it in the properties file for developers, automated tests and auto reduction.

## Actions

Keith to work on prototyping and testing the proposed implementation. (30 May 2018)

David to look at the separation of workspace and plotting states in `Save Project`. (June 2018)
