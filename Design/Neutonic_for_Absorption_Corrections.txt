How to get neutronics information into absorption corections

In a nutshell: Build new materials object in run object to hold parameters needed for absorption corrections

Work:
* Material object has needed parameters:  absorbXSection(AttenuationXSection), totalScatterXSection(ScatteringXSection), and numberDensity(SampleNumberDensity).  Add also parameters to scale with wavelength for using tables.
* New SetMaterial algorithm to set these parameters from user input or using the chemical formula input in NeutronAtom.  This algorithm will also set the name of the material
* Use this Materials object in all absorption correction algorithms but leave present input of parameters as option:
	AbsorptionCorrection         CylinderAbsorption     MonteCarloAbsorption 
	AnyShapeAbsorption           FlatPlateAbsorption    MultipleScatteringCylinderAbsorption 
	CuboidGaugeVolumeAbsorption  HRPDSlabCanAbsorption  SphericalAbsorption 
        AnvredCorrections
* Rewrite NeutronAtom to use lookup table or read file whichever is more efficient (try both)
* New algorithm for absorption corrections for cylindrical samples using tables
* New algorithms for absorption corrections for cans and powder in cans using both MonteCarlo and tables (will expand later)
