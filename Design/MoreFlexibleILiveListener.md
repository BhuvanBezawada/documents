More flexible live listener interface
=====================================

Motivation
----------

The LiveListeners are not flexible enough and cause problems at collaborator facilities and external facilities where Mantid is used. Specific problems listed below.

Problems To Fix
---------------

**Mandatory**

* Should be able to get the create a ILiveListener via the factory in a way that allows Dynamic Properties to be considered prior to the connection being made.
* Knowing the Instrument is not enough. The `LiveListenerFactory` uses the instrument name to get the `InstrumentInfo` and from that the connection properties. But this does not allow support for more than one live data stream per instrument.
* Should be able to easily get an `ILiveListener` in the unconnected state
* Should be able to create an `ILiveListener` without querying instrument/facility info by specifying the address and class name in the `StartLiveData` algorithm.

How Things Currently Work
-------------------------

* The *Facilities.xml* file allows you to specify listeners like this `<livedata address="NDXENGINX:10000" listener="ISISLiveEventDataListener" />`. The listener is the concrete ILiveListener class name that will be used to create ILiveListener objects. If a listener is not specified at the instrument level, then the listener at the facilities level of the xml hierachy will be used instead.
* Listeners speicified in the *Facilities.xml* file are created via the `LiveListenerFactory` `DynamicFactory`  [here](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/master/Framework/API/src/LiveListenerFactory.cpp#L44:L45) from a `std::string`
* The bare listener objects are connected via `connect(const Poco::Net::SocketAddress &address)`
* Once a connection has been made. The listener can be Started, Stopped.  
* The main hook point is extractData() `virtual boost::shared_ptr<Workspace> extractData() = 0;`
* Each implementation of the `ILiveListener` has the ability to receive and use additional things at runtime. More below.

ILiveListener as a PropertyManager
##################################

* `ILiveListener` inherits from `PropertyManager` 
* `LiveDataAlgorithm` is the base type of `StartLiveData` and other algorthims using the live data streams.
* `LiveDataAlgorithm` calls the `LiveListenerFactory` via it's `LiveDataAlgorithm::getLiveListener()` method [here](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/master/Framework/LiveData/src/StartLiveData.cpp#L146)
* Crutially in `LiveDataAlgorithm::getLiveListener()` it passes a pointer to itself through to the `LiveListenerFactory::create()`.
* Remembering that `LiveDataAlgorithm` is also a type of `PropertyManager`, the `LiveListenerFactory::create()` is then able to copy all it's properties over to the specific `ILiveListener` type. This is done [here](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/master/Framework/API/src/LiveListenerFactory.cpp#L48)
* Now the `LiveDataListener` has the same properties as the calling algorithm, it has access to things like the `SpectraList` off the calling algorithm. Example [here](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/master/Framework/LiveData/src/ISISHistoDataListener.cpp#L105)

Order of Connection
####################

As used at the moment, `LiveDataAlgorithm` has a gateway function called [getLiveListener](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/master/Framework/LiveData/src/LiveDataAlgorithm.cpp#L186:L197), which forces `LiveListenerFactory::create()` to returns a `ILiveDataListener` on which connect has been called because the connect argument is set to true. `getLiveListener` also starts the listener.If you don't have enough information to start the connection at that point. The connection will simply fail. In addition, even if you have dynamic properties that could be used to create a connection, these cannot be used because `LiveListenerFactory::create()` will establish the connection first, and then copy dynamic properties over.

Questions
---------
Mark mentioned that we are missing a Watcher Algorithm. It's unclear what is required that's not already handled by `MontiorLiveData` and `LoadLiveData` via `StartLiveData`?


Possible solutions
------------------

### Option 1. Dynamic properties on StartLiveData

One problem is that properties are applied after connections are made. A simple fix would be to reorder the `LiveListenerFactory::create` so that properties are always copied between calling `Algorithm` and `ILiveListener` immediately after creation of the `ILiveListener` and before any connection is called. This will give much more power to each subtype of `ILiveListener` to decide to override the standard connection information such as address etc if it has been provided as a dynamic property.

### Option 2. Add Named Component Option

The general problem we are trying to solve is that the instrument is assumed to have a single live listener. This solution introduces the possibility of more than one live listener per instrument and introduces a name key. The resulting xml can then take this form

```xml
 <instrument name="LET_EVENT" shortname="LET">
    <zeropadding size="8"/>
    <technique>Neutron Spectroscopy</technique>
    <technique>TOF Direct Geometry Spectroscopy</technique>
    <livedata default_name="instrument">
     <address="NDXLET:10000" listener="ISISLiveEventDataListener" name="instrument"/>
     <address="NDXLET:10001" listener="ISISLiveEventDataListener" name="detector1" />
     <address="NDXLET:10002" listener="ISISLiveEventDataListener" name="bank1" />
    </livedata>
  </instrument>
```
The `LiveDataAlgorithm` base class is then given the ability to provide an optional name input. This solution can be implemented in addition to the one provided above. Both forms of flexibility might be useful.



#### Solution Details

1. Currently LiveListener XML get's parsed [here in FacilityInfo](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/master/Framework/Kernel/src/FacilityInfo.cpp#L139:L146) for facility level listeners  and [here in InstrumentInfo](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/master/Framework/Kernel/src/InstrumentInfo.cpp#L223:L250) for instrument level listeners  the latter is the most in this context important. `InstrumentInfo` has `m_liveDataAddress` and `m_liveListener` (name of class to create object from). We start with a new type called `LiveListenerMemeto`. The two attributes should be members of this new type. `name` should also be added as a member, but may not be initialized (empty string).   `LiveListenerMemeto` should be first-class citizen in Mantid like `FacilityInfo` and `InstrumentInfo`
1. Refactor mantid to use the above `LiveListenterMemeto` For example, return one from [InstrumentInfo::livelistener()](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/master/Framework/Kernel/inc/MantidKernel/InstrumentInfo.h#L68) 
1. Give InstrumentInfo the ability to return all LiveListenerMemetos (as a collection) via a new method.
1. [Fix this](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/master/Framework/API/src/LiveListenerFactory.cpp#L36) to take a name string, that defaults to an empty string. If specified it should use that to select the right LiveListenerMemeto to create the live listener from. Otherwise it should just create one without any name specified. [LiveDataAlgorithm::getLiveListener]( https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/master/Framework/LiveData/src/LiveDataAlgorithm.cpp#L186:L197) should take the name string and forward it to the above method. `LiveDataAlgorithm` should provide an additional non-mandatory property called "Name", if the "Name" property is provided, it should be checked at validateInputs() time against possible Name options available for the selected "Instrument" property declared in [LiveDataAlgorithm] (https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/master/Framework/LiveData/src/LiveDataAlgorithm.cpp#L55)


### Option 3. Overload the `LiveListenerFactory` connect

Currently `LiveListenerFactory::create` as called by `LiveDataAlgorithm` will:

1. Load the Instrument and then InstrumentInfo for the specified *Instrument* name argument. All taken from the Facility file.
1. Extract the concrete ILiveListener from the above and create an instance of one
1. Connect it from the address specified above

The only thing that any `create` method should do is Create the relevant object, and we should have a way of providing the ILiveListenter class name ourselves, and connecting the product ourselves. 

The completed solution would allow users to specify the stuff usually loaded from the facilities.xml file directly in `StartLiveData` namely the address, ILiveListener name and component name. If provided the code would not try to then fetch that information from the instrument.

**In this solution users would be able to use `StartLiveData` and completely bypass the Facilities.xml file.** Again, this can be added in parallel to the above fixes.
