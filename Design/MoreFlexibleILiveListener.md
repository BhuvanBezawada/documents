More flexible live listener interface
=====================================

Motivation
----------

ILiveListener interface requires that an implementation takes only the instrument name and a network address to create itself. 
If these are not enough there is no way to pass additional information in. For external facilities, we need the ability to provide flexible listners via the plugin/dll mechanism offered via the dyanmic factories, that way custom dependencies can be managed by those external facilities and not added to all distributions of Mantid.

How Things Currently Work
-------------------------

* The *Facilities.xml* file allows you to specify listeners like this `<livedata address="NDXENGINX:10000" listener="ISISLiveEventDataListener" />`
* Listeners speicified in the *Facilities.xml* file are created via the `LiveListenerFactory` `DynamicFactory`  [here](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/master/Framework/API/src/LiveListenerFactory.cpp#L44:L45) from a `std::string`
* The bare listener objects are connected via `connect(const Poco::Net::SocketAddress &address)`
* Once a connection has been made. The listener can be Started, Stopped.  
* The main hook point is extractData() `virtual boost::shared_ptr<Workspace> extractData() = 0;`
* Each implementation of the `ILiveListner` has the ability to receive and use additional things at runtime. More below.

ILiveListner as a PropertyManager
##################################

* `ILiveListener` inherits from `PropertyManager` 
* `LiveDataAlgorithm` is the base type of `StartLiveData` and other algorthims using the live data streams.
* `LiveDataAlgorithm` calls the `LiveListenerFactory` via it's `LiveDataAlgorithm::getLiveListener()` method
* Crutially in `LiveDataAlgorithm::getLiveListener()` it passes a pointer to itself through to the `LiveListenerFactory::create()`.
* Remembering that `LiveDataAlgorithm` is also a type of `PropertyManager`, the `LiveListenerFactory::create()` is then able to copy all it's properties over to the specific `ILiveListener` type. This is done [here](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/master/Framework/API/src/LiveListenerFactory.cpp#L48)
* Now the `LiveDataListener` has the same properties as the calling algorithm, it has access to things like the `SpectraList` off the calling algorithm. Example [here](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/master/Framework/LiveData/src/ISISHistoDataListener.cpp#L105)

Problems To Fix
---------------

**Mandatory**

* `LiveListenerFactory::create()` returns a `ILiveDataListener` on which connect has been called. If you don't have enough information to start the connection at that point. The connection will simply fail.
* Knowing the Instrument is not enough. The `LiveListenerFactory` uses the instrument name to get the `InstrumentInfo` and from that the connection properties. But this does not allow support for more than one live data stream per instrument.

**Nice To Fix**

* Reliance on runtime properties is cumbersome. If I want to create an ILiveListner, I need to call it from something that implements all the machinery of `PropertyManager`.

Questions
---------
Mark mentioned that we are missing a Watcher Algorithm. It's unclear what is required that's not already handled by `MontiorLiveData` and `LoadLiveData` via `StartLiveData`?


Possible solutions
------------------

### Dynamic properties on StartLiveData

The solution here is to specify the connection address as a property, and change/extend the LiveListenerFactory so that the connections are not applied until the client chooses to.

1. `ILiveListener` is a property manager and can have properties.
2. `StartLiveData` creates disconnected instance of a ILiveListener in its init() method.
3. It copies properties from the listener (dynamic properties). 
4. The properties are set by the caller.
5. The exec() method passes the set properties to the listener and connects it.

The instrument name should be enough for creating a disconnected listener. ILiveListener::connect() doesn't have to have an argument.
The neccessary information can be provided through properties.

Instrument parameters files can be used to store additional information such as network addresses.

There is no need to implement or have knowledge of the PropertyManager machinery. Properties can be set with simple setProperty(...) calls.

### Not using ILiveListener

Unofficial Mantid plugins do not have to use ILiveListener to collect live data. If the interface is incompatible with the
instrument's systems the plugin can define an independent custom algorithm for collecting data. MantidPlot can be configured
to use this algorithm instead of StartLiveData in Load->Live Data button menu.
