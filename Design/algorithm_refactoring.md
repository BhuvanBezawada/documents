# Cleaning up Mantid Algorithms

## Motivation

See discussions during the developer workshop in January 2016.

This document is meant as a base for discussion and does not (yet) represent a complete design. The results of this and potentially various parts of this document will eventually be used to create documentation for developers on how to write an algorithm.


## N kinds of boilerplate code


### Progress

```cpp
Progress progress(this, 0.0, 1.0, m_numberOfSpectra);
// [...]
progress.report();
```

This can be done in the proposed `Algorithm::transform` method, see below.


### Getters on workspaces

Typically when looping over spectra, one or several getters are used on workspaces, for event lists, spectra, and histograms. For example, `getEventList()`, `getSpectrum()`, and `readX()`, `readY()`, `readE()`.

There may be a way to combine this with what is described in the proposed `Algorithm::transform` method below, but it is not obvious how to get rid of these entirely.


### Looping over spectra

The loop over histograms comprises various kinds of boilerplate:

- The `for`-loop statement itself
- `PARALLEL` macros, which in turn contain:
  - OpenMP pragmas
  - A mechanism for cancellation
  - Parallel exception handling

  Typically there are 4 `PARALLEL` macros for a single loop over spectra.

To get rid of these, we would like to implement something along the lines of `std::transform`. In our case it turns out to be most convenient to make this a member of `Algorithm`, since our `transform` needs access to various members of `Algorithm`, in particular:

- The `PARALLEL` macros access `m_cancel`, `m_parallelException` (which, however, could be made local), and `g_log` (which may not be necessary, strictly speaking).
- We would like to move the `Progress` code into our `transform`, so we need the `this` pointer.

If it were not a member we would need some way of passing all these things into our `transform`, which is cumbersome.

In the simplest case (in-place modification of a single field), this could be implemented along the lines of this:

```cpp
// Note that we need the explicit syntax ELEM (WS::*getter)(IDX), else the compiler cannot resolve (const) overloads
template <class WS, class OP, class ELEM, class IDX>
void transform(WS &workspace, ELEM (WS::*getter)(IDX), const OP &operation) {
  int length = workspace.getNumberHistograms();
  auto progress = Kernel::make_unique<API::Progress>(this, 0.0, 1.0, length);
  auto getArg = std::mem_fn(getter);
  PARALLEL_FOR1((&workspace))
  for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
    PARALLEL_START_INTERUPT_REGION
    operation(getArg(workspace, i));
    progress->report(name());
    PARALLEL_END_INTERUPT_REGION
  }
  PARALLEL_CHECK_INTERUPT_REGION
  workspace.clearMRU();
}
```

Usage would then be, e.g.,

```cpp
transform(ws, &EventWorkspace::getEventList, my_eventlist_rebin);
```

Things to consider in the design:

- We do not want to call `transform` unnecessarily often. Many algorithms consist of various micro-steps. If we do a separate transform for each of those steps we would end up loading all our data from memory many times.

  A common solution to solve this problem are expression templates, but the generic nature of the things we do (i.e., not just chaining of simple operations like `+` and `*`) would probably make this cumbersome.

  Instead, it is probably best to compose a "top-level" function or functor that calls functions or functors implementing the various micro-steps. We would then pass the top-level callable to `transform`.

-  We need to provide means to deal with several in- and outputs, e.g., in the common case of an input and output `MatrixWorkspace`, where we need x, y, and error data for both input and output. There are also cases that are more complex than that

- Why pass both a workspace and a getter to transform instead of just a function binding to the correct workspace and getter?
  - The `PARALLEL` macros need the workspace to check whether or not parallel execution is possible.
  - We may want to call things like `workspace.clearMRU();`.
  - The users of `transform` would need to use `std::bind`, which is a bit nasty when binding to overloaded functions, e.g., the `const` overloads we have for getters on our workspaces: Basically you need to cast explicitly, e.g.,

    ```cpp
    std::bind((double &(std::vector<double>::*)(size_t))&std::vector<double>::operator[], &data, _1)
    ```

    Note that it is not possible to use implicit type conversion in combination with templates. Suppose we modify `transform` to take a `std::function<T&(size_t)>` as a getter. We then **cannot** use

    ```cpp
    transform(/*...*/,
              std::bind((double &(std::vector<double>::*)(size_t))&std::vector<double>::operator[],
                        &data,
                       _1), /*...*/);
     ```

     but need to take a detour via a variable,

    ```cpp
    auto func = std::bind((double &(std::vector<double>::*)(size_t)) &
                                      std::vector<double>::operator[],
                                  &data, _1);
    transform(/*...*/, func, &data, _1), /*...*/);
       ```



Furthermore, we would probably want to provide overloads for supporting the following cases:

- Transform for all spectra.
- Transform for a range of spectra.
- Transform for a list of spectra.


### Casting of input workspaces to specific workspace types

```cpp
// Check if its an event workspace
EventWorkspace_const_sptr eventW =
    boost::dynamic_pointer_cast<const EventWorkspace>(inputWS);
if (eventW != NULL) {
  this->execEvent();
  return;
}
```

A very nice way to solve this would be to use the **visitor pattern**:

- Add the following method to `Algorithm`:
  ```cpp
  virtual std::string getInputWorkspaceForVisitorPattern() const {
    return std::string{};
  }
   ```
  Algorithm implementations that have an input workspace and support the visitor pattern reimplement this function and return the name of the input workspace property.
- Add a method like this to all Workspace types:
  ```cpp
  void Workspace2D::apply(API::Algorithm &algorithm) {
    algorithm.apply(*this);
  }
  ```
- `Algorithm::Execute()` calls `getInputWorkspaceForVisitorPattern()` to obtain a workspace `ws` and then calls `ws.apply(*this);`
- All algorithms implement `apply` for various workspace types.

The last bullet is where it all starts to fall apart, there is a fatal flaw in this mechanism: Inheritance does not go well with overloading. For the visitor pattern to work we would need to implement `Algorithm::apply` for **all workspace types**. What we would actually like to do is, e.g., implement `Rebin::apply(const MatrixWorkspace &ws)` and `Rebin::apply(const EventWorkspace &ws)`. Calling the algorithm with a `Workspace2D` will then **not** resolve to `Rebin::apply(const MatrixWorkspace &ws)` but `Algorithm::apply(const Workspace2D &ws)`.

The conclusion is that currently there is **no reasonable way for using the visitor pattern** in this case.

- Are there other ways to solve the some problem?
- Reconsider the visitor pattern when redesigning workspaces.


### Creating output `EventWorkspace`

Replace

```cpp
// Make a brand new EventWorkspace
outputWS = boost::dynamic_pointer_cast<EventWorkspace>(
    API::WorkspaceFactory::Instance().create(
        "EventWorkspace", inputWS->getNumberHistograms(), 2, 1));
// Copy geometry over.
API::WorkspaceFactory::Instance().initializeFromParent(inputWS, outputWS,
                                                       false);
// You need to copy over the data as well.
outputWS->copyDataFrom((*inputWS));
```

with

```cpp
outputWS = inputWS->clone();
```


### Code for dealing with input and output workspaces

Apart from the bits covered by the discussion above on casting and creating output event workspaces, there are also others:

- Dealing with the case `inputWS == outputWS`, which is particularly bad in the case of `EventWorkspace`, since it requires even more casting.
- Setting the output workspace property.

  ```cpp
  this->setProperty("OutputWorkspace", outputWS);
   ```


### More potential candidates

#### Ranges or lists of spectra

There seem to be quite a few algorithms which either run on all spectra, a user-defined range of spectra, or a user-defined list of spectra. We should have a generic way to deal with this.


## Library of smaller building blocks

An algorithm implementation that uses a `Algorithm::transform` as described above needs to provide some sort of callable to it. The callable would typically do something to a spectrum, a histogram, or an event list. The callable will typically be specific to the particular algorithm, however, in most cases, it will contain many bits that can be reused. We need to:

- Provide a library of commonly used bits. This can be functions or functors, but probably both.
- Figure out if there is a reasonable way for automatic chaining of those bits to build the top-level callable.
- Have a reasonable way to document and search the existing bits, such that developers will use them in their algorithms.
