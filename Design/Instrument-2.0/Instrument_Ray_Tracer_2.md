# Instrument Ray Tracer 2.0
## Design Document

## Introduction
The current implementation of [`InstrumentRayTracer`](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/master/Framework/Geometry/inc/MantidGeometry/Objects/InstrumentRayTracer.h#L56) works off the orginal `Instrument` API and not the `Instrument 2.0` layers, such as `ComponentInfo`, `DetectorInfo` and `SpectrumInfo`. Due to this, there is a dependency on `Instrument` in `Peak` and as such it is currently not possible to move away from using this legacy API. The intention is to stop developers needing access to the `Instrument` API and instead steer them towards using the new `Geometry` and `Beamline` layers as mentioned above.

## Overview
The goal of this document is to outline a plan for the new `InstrumentRayTracer` and to figure out how to move away from making any calls to the legacy API. The areas of discussion in this document include:

 * Implementation details of `InstrumentRayTracer 2.0`
   * Reuse of original code
   * Possible new methods
   * Usage of new implementation
     
 * Using the functionality of `ComponentInfo`
   * Determining what code would actually be useful
   * Incorporating it into the new implementation
   
 * Rolling out the changes
   * Figuring out what a possible API would look like 
   * Outlining what changes would have to be made to the code base
   * How to ensure that performance is good enough
 
## Implementation Details of `InstrumentRayTracer 2.0`
#### Reuse of Original Code
One idea for the implementation of `InstrumentRayTracer 2.0` is to have many of the old methods from `InstrumentRayTracer` carried over. This is would be a good way to proceed as it would hopefully mean that there will not be as many breaking changes to worry about. The methods to be replaced would be where the legacy API calls are made - i.e. anything that uses `Instrument` could be modified so that the new `Geometry` and `Beamline` layers are used instead. Methods headers that could be kept the same include:

 * `void trace(const Kernel::V3D &dir) const`
 * `void traceFromSample(const Kernel::V3D &dir) const`
 * `Links getResults() const`
 * `IDetector_const_sptr getDetectorResult() const`
 * `void fireRay(Track &testRay) const`

#### Possible New Methods
Although the headers do not explicity have anything to do with `Instrument`, many of the method bodies make use of the member variable `m_instrument` to carry out various tasks. This variable is created and initialised in the constructor. From looking at the implementation in [`InstrumentRayTracer.cpp`](), it seems that the constructor is the one place where there is a dependence on `Instrument` and this is probably the one area that needs to be fully rewritten.

#### Usage of New Implementation
If all goes well with the plan to use `ComponentInfo` where possible, it is very likely that the code to use `InstrumentRayTracer 2.0` will be very similar to the old way.  

## Using the Functionality of `ComponentInfo`
It seems that using the functionality of `ComponentInfo` is very much possible and might well be the best way to proceed.
The newly exposed `ComponentInfo` layer is accessible from a workspace - examples of usage can be found [here](). Possible methods that could be used in `InstrumentRayTracer 2.0` might include:

 * `componentInfo.getSource()` in `void InstrumentRayTracer::trace(const V3D &dir) const`
 * `componentInfo.getSample()` in `void InstrumentRayTracer::traceFromSample(const V3D &dir) const`

## Rolling out the Changes
Before rolling out any changes, it is probably a good idea to develop a new set of tests exclusively for this new class. Some tests (especially for methods that do not make calls to the legacy API) could probably be based on the existing tests with a few alterations. 

#### Figuring out a Possible API
Once the `InstrumentRayTracer 2.0` class is actually implemented, it might be worth creating a separate design document (as done for `ComponentInfo`, `DetectorInfo` and `SpectrumInfo`) to breifly outline which methods would be best to expose to the Python side.

#### Changes to the Code Base
The best way to completely move away from using `InstrumentRayTracer` (and not completely break everything) would be to start with a selection of "testing files" that currently use the `InstrumentRayTracer` e.g `Peak` and begin to change them one by one. Once all of those files are in working order it would provide enough confidence in the new implementation and all the other files can then be updated.

#### Performance Issues
To ensure that the new implementation performs just as well as the existing version, benchmarking tools could be used to record the current performance and this can be used as a target for the new implementation.
