##Scope of Work##

The following the first-draft of the high-level [requirements](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Design/Instrument-2.0/requirements-v2.md) approval on 22nd January 2016, an inital set of activies where identified to form the first milestone. 

###Activities Requested###

Many of these are questions to unknowns:

1. What functions are called through Geometry. What are the questions we need to ask of the system. (Owen Arnold)
1. What questions are users/instrument scientists going to ask of the Geometry outside workspace/algorithm related calculations. Example: beam shape at component. (Owen Arnold)
1. Evaluate user geometry use cases (Tim Charlton / Owen Arnold)
1. Scanning addition prototype. How bad will the performance be the event-based time positioning be? (Martyn Gigg)
1. Investigate standards for binary file formats for the IDF HDF5/VTK etc (Pete/Andrei)
1. Investigate how [McStas](http://www.mcstas.org/download/components/) and [McVine](https://github.com/mcvine/resources/blob/master/instruments/ARCS/resources/ARCS.xml) describes complex components (Owen Arnold)
