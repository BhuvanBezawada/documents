## Purpose

There is increased interest within the Mantid project to develop a good strategy/instruction set for developing external GUIs. We are also considering how we might distribute such GUIs as part of a Mantid "Super Build". This document is a requested output from the TSC [October 2016 meeting](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Project-Management/TechnicalSteeringCommittee/meetings/2016/TSC-meeting-2016-10-11.md)
## Motivation

* To users, "User interface *X* is Mantid"
* We except (have accepted) contributions of whole user interfaces. 
* Many UIs have not been constructed in a way that allows extension or maintenace
* We find that most user critical issues and bugs appear in user interfaces rather than the core 
* Mantid developers spend a vast amount of time looking after these UI's which are not a core part of Mantid
* The [5-year plan/vision](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Project-Management/PMB/Minutes/PMBMinutes-2016-01-22.docx) (January 2015) requires us to be able to distribute the numerical/kernel Mantid packages without the GUIs
* External developers cannot control the development lifecyles of their GUIs separately from Mantid

Some of these items were reported at the [2016 developer workshop](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Presentations/DevMeetings/2016-01/UseabilityReliability/ui_useability_and_reliability.pdf)

## Inventory of Internal GUIs

| Name        | Facility           | Technique  | Good features  | Bad features  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:| -----:|
| Reflectometry Old     | ISIS | Reflectometry |  python | Everything else about this is bad  |
| Reflectometry Old     | ISIS | Reflectometry |  <ul><li>created from sub-components</li><li>proven robust</li><li>well tested</li><li>sophistocated but maintainable</li></ul> | c++  |


## Inventory of External GUIs

## Recommendations

TODO: Just Ideas at this stage.
**Requirements of External GUIs to be part of a super build.**

The GUI Must have a **.mantid.yml** file containing:

1. A named **Maintainer**. The name and contact information of the maintainer should be visible/accesible in a standard way on the GUI.
1. A list of versions of Mantid for which the **Maintainer** has signed-off the GUI to work against
1. Documentation that can be dragged into the Mantid distribution. 

This should also be true:

1. GUI should meet a minimum requirement of test coverage to prove that it has been well exercised
1. GUI should as far as possible use standard Mantid exported widgets to give a common look/feel? DataProcessorWidget (batch reduction).
1. GUI should preferably be written in python
