# Splitting TimeSeriesProperty

Assume that a TimeSeriesProperty `P` has entries (t\_0, v\_0), (t\_1, v\_1), ..., (t\_n, v\_n).
It is split by a set of (N-1) splitters, (T\_0, T\_1, w\_0), (T\_1, T\_2, w\_1), ... and (T\_(N-1), T\_N, w\_(N-1)).

## Split TimeSeriesProperty use case 1

In this case, there are more than 1 entry of TimeSeriesPrperty `P` between the start and stop time of a splitter i, i..e,  T\_(i-1), and T\_i, respectively. 
And The split entries will be written to a new TimeSeriesProperty indexed as w\_(i-1)).
Then in `P`, it can be found an entry j and and entry k, where j < k, such that
t\_(j-1) <= T\_(i-1) < t\_j, and t\_(k-1) < T\_i <= t\_k.
The split-out TimeSeriresProperty by this splitter shall contain the entries as (t\_(j-1), t\_j, ..., t\_k),
which will be written to output TimeSeriesProperty indexed as w\_(i-1).

## Split TimeSeriesProperty use case 2

In this case, there are more than 1 consecutive splitters within an entry j of `P`.
Such that t\_j < T\_i < T\_(i+s+1) < t\_(j+1), where s is the number of splitters within entry j.
Then no splitting is required to `P`'s j entry in this situation.

## Special case: Proton charge

A proton charge log is stored in a  TimeSeriesProperty.
Assume that the total proton charge is `C`.
If this log is split to `P\_ 1`, `P\_2`, ..., `P\_m`, and the total proton charges for 
each split log are `C\_ 1`, `C\_2`, ..., `C\_m`, respectively.
Then the sum of  `C\_ 1`, `C\_2`, ..., `C\_m` shall be `C`.

The special case comes from a splitter's start or stop time is within a proton charge log's entry.
For example for a splitter i, whose start time T\_i is inside a proton charge entry j, such that
t\_j < T\_i < t\_(j+1).
Since it is not supposed to split a proton charge log entry, and 
it is assumed that the proton charge is constant within an arbitrary entry,
the solution is to modify the proton charge value of that entry by the portion of the time of the split entry,
such that the split entry shall be from t\_j to t\_(j+1), and its value is modified 
to v_j x (t\_(j+1) - T\_i) / (t\_(j+1) - t\_j), where v_j is the proton charge value of entry j.
