Image handling methods for Matrix Workspaces
============================================

Motivation
----------

Handling Imaging data with Workspace 2D structures is awkward, both for storing data and for plotting.

Current system for handling imange data
---------------------------------------

There are two approaches that have been attempted,
1) Storing data using X and Y as the axes, and single value intensity as the pixel data.  This works well with data loading and simple plotting, but fails with more advanced plotting such as the instrument view and most algorithms wil not run.
2)
