Summary
=======

This document describes the layout and high-level details of the new matplotlib-based workbench that will replace MantidPlot.

Workflow
========

The new workbench will be developed on a long-running feature branch within the main [`mantid`][mantidrepo] repository. The exception to this is the new directory
structure described below for the graphical components. These changes will be made on the `master` branch prior to any work starting on the workbench. This
will minimize the effect of merge conflicts on existing components that are going to be reused.

## Merging & Removal of MantidPlot

There will become a point when the new workbench has enough features to be releasable to the general audience as a viable replacement for MantidPlot. MantidPlot would not be removed at
this point until we can be satisfied that the new workbench serves our current users needs. See section in [architeture](design-arch) section regarding widget code shared between MantidPlot
and the new workbench.

Source Code Directory Structure
===============================

The following diagram indicates the proposed directory structure for the graphical components.

```
mantid.git
   |-- Framework
   |-- MantidPlot
   |-- qt
       |-- applications
       |   |-- mantidworkbench
       |-- paraview_ext
       |-- resources
       |-- scientific_interfaces
       |   |-- CMakeLists.txt
       |   |-- Diffraction
       |   |   |-- PowderDiffractionReduction
       |   |       |-- Powder_Diffraction_Reduction.py
       |   |       |-- Powder_Diffraction_Reduction
       |   |       |   |-- ...
       |   |-- Indirect
       |   |   |-- Common
       |   |   |-- Corrections
       |   |   |-- DataAnalysis
       |   |-- Muon
       |   |   |-- ALC
       |   |   |-- DataAnalysis
       |   |-- Reflectometry
       |   |   |-- ISISReflectometry
       |   |       |-- ISIS_Reflectometry.py
       |   |       |-- ISIS_Reflectometry
       |   |       |   |-- ...
       |-- python
       |   |-- mantidqt # python mantidqt module
       |       |-- reduction_gui # Python reduction gui framework
       |       |-- widgets # would contain combine qtwidgetscommon.dll with sip exports to give mantidqt.widgets python library
       |       |-- __init__.py
       |-- widgets
           |-- common # qtwidgetscommon.dll
           |-- plugins
           |   |-- algorithm_dialogs # qtwidgetspluginsalgorithm_dialogs.dll
           |   |-- designer # qtwidgetspluginsdesigner.dll
           |-- instrumentview # qtwidgetsinstrumentview.dll
           |-- spectrumviewer # qtwidgetsspectrumviewer.dll
           |-- sliceviewer # qtwidgetssliceviewer.dll
```

Mapping of the current structure to this is as follows:

 - `/MantidPlot`: NOT MOVED (will be deleted once replacement is up to scratch)
 - `/Vates` --> `/qt/paraview_ext`
 - `/MantidQt/API/` & `/MantidQt/MantidWidgets/` combined --> `/qt/widgets/common`
 - `/MantidQt/MantidWidgets/InstrumentView` --> `qt/widgets/instrumentview`
 - `/MantidQt/RefDetectorViewer` --> `/qt/widgets/refdetectorview`
 - `/MantidQt/SpectrumViewer` --> `/qt/widgets/spectrumviewer`
 - `/MantidQt/SliceViewer` --> `/qt/widgets/sliceviewer`
 - `/MantidQt/CustomDialogs` --> `/qt/widgets/plugins/algorithm_dialogs`
 - `/MantidQt/DesignerPlugins` --> `/qt/widgets/plugins/designer`
 - `/MantidQt/Python` --> `/qt/python`
 - Remove Factory directory as it seems unecessary
 - All resources, fonts, images etc, moved under qt/resources

Shared libraries will follow a naming structure that includes all of their parent directories.

`.ui` files should be kept with the header files of the corresponding classes.

Technologies
============

The workbench will be written primarily in Python using:

 - [PyQt5][PyQt5]
 - [matplotlib][matplotlib_org]
 - [IPython][IPython]

`sip` will be used for exporting any required C/C++ to Python. `boost.python` will be maintained for the framework exports.

See a note in [architecture design](design-arch.md) about Qwt and existing interfaces/widgets.

Python 2/3
----------

Due to the requirement to support RedHat 7 we will continue to write Python 2/3 compatible code.

PyQt shim
----------

An abstraction layer around `PyQt4`, `PyQt5`, `PySide` will be used to wrap all calls to PyQt functionality. This should reduce
portability concerns in the future when its inevitable that a PyQt6 will come out. The shim should provide a similar layer
of protection as it currently does between `PyQt4` & `PyQt5`.

We could either write our own, use those provided by other dependencies: [matplotlib][matplotlib_qtcompat], [IPython][IPython] or
use a separate package such as [qtpy][qtpy] provided by the [Spyder][Spyder] developers. My suggestion would be using [qtpy][qtpy].

Packaging & Deployment
======================

Python
------

The framework package will remain separate and called `mantid`.

The new ui python package will be called `mantidqt` and have the following submodules:

 - mantidqt.plotting: contain custom plotting code based on matplotlib, i.e keep/make current behaviour, custom toolbars, custom figure window
 - mantidqt.widgets: contain these set of reusable widgets used to build the workbench & its components

The workbench will be called `mantidworkbench` and depend on `mantudqt` & `mantid`. In Anaconda We will have the following packages, in addition to the current `mantid-framework` package:

 - `mantid-qt`: gives you `mantidqt` python package
 - `mantid-workbench`: gives you the new workbench

Installation
------------

Installation procedures will differ across platforms. During alpha testing, a separate installers will be available to give to friendly users to test. When we are confident that the workbench is ready for wider
viewing we will want to ship to abilities wider audience. At this point the strategy on each platform will differ. The alpha packages will be called:

* Windows/OSX: mantidpreview - A combined package bundling everthing, much as we currently do. Defaults to a different install location than current
* Linux: `mantidpreview-framework`, `mantidpreview-qt`, `mantidpreview-workbench`: separate packages to allow just dependencies on widgets etc.

### Windows

The new package structure defined below will be put in place both applications shipped inside the main installer.

### OSX

The generated bundle will contain both applications and users can choose to drag over the new workbench if they want.


### Linuxes

The existing packages can add a dependency on the beta workbench packages to install these at the same time.


Windows Installed Layout
========================

Our windows installation structure is poorly layed out. For example the `bin` directory contains many files and it is difficult to navigate and also contains our Python bundle. A new layout, based on the
[miniconda][miniconda] layout on Windows, is proposed. It is as follows:

```
C:\MantidInstall
  |-- bin
  |-- instrument # instrument definitions
  |-- library
  |   |-- bin # dependent DLLs: boost, poco, core mantid libraries, vtk etc
  |   |-- plugins
  |   |   |-- mantid # Our plugins
  |   |   |   |-- python # python algorithms
  |   |   |   |-- qt
  |   |   |-- pvplugins
  |   |   |-- qt # Qt plugins for image formats etc
  |-- python2.7
  |-- scripts # existing scripts directory
  |-- share
      |-- colormaps
      |-- docs
```

This will require a small patch in `python2.7\Lib\site.py` to add the `library\bin` directory to the `PATH` on startup and also set the `MANTIDPATH` variable.
Anaconda make a similar modification to the `PATH` in their bundled Python installation.
