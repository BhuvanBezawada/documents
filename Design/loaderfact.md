(A good example is in Design/DataProcessorAlgorithmUI.md)

##Motivation##

I've been working on decomentating how data from a file (usually a Nexus file) is read by a loader 
and is transferred to a workspace. I have found it difficult to do. 
If the code for the loaders was cleaner, I'd expect to easily see how each item of data
goes from file to workspace and so easily produce a table such as the one at 
[[http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/algorithms/LoadISISNexus-v2.html#data-loaded-from-nexus-file]]

##Requirements##

**Must Haves**

Add a numbered list of things that the design *must* address

**Could Haves (Future considerations)**

Add a numbered list of things that the design *could* address but it would not be vital to cover

##Selected Use cases##

Add a selection of use cases

##Current Structure##

If the design addresses a current issue then briefly describe the current solution to the problem

##Proposed Solution##

Summarize the proposed solution

##Solution Details##
