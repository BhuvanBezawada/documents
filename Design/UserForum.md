Motivation
==========

Our current help system is limited and is not considered very effective. Some limitations are:

  * initial email contact is limited to small group of people
  * answers only get seen by the person sending the question
  * emails can be missed and then nothing ever happens

PMB has asked that we setup a forum and use this as our main communication with users. 

This document will not follow the usual design document format but will be used to track choices/decisions made about
various options.
