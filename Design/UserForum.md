Motivation
==========

Our current help system is limited and is not considered very effective. Some limitations are:

  * initial email contact is limited to small group of people
  * answers only get seen by the person sending the question
  * emails can be missed and then nothing ever happens

PMB has asked that we setup a forum and use this as our main communication with users. 

This document will not follow the usual design document format but will be used to track choices/decisions made about
various options.

Requirements
============
1. Can signup/signin without tremendous hurdles
2. Anonymous posting ????
3. Posts to mantid-help will have to be inserted (manually/automatically) (not so sure about this we can change where we direct people)
4. UI must be simple enough to not need (much) documentation
5. Price ???
6. Responsive from all mantid partner facilities
