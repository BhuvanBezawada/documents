#Anaconda#

The purpose of this document is to examine the feasibility of providing conda
packages for Mantid framework and/or Mantid GUI for Mantid users.

##Motivation##

Ana(conda) makes it much easier to manage the deployment of a software package itself
and probably more importantly, its dependencies.
Although only started in 2012, it has seen widespread acceptance in the python community
and even high performance computing community. 
An example is that NERSC has conda installed as a module.

**What is (ana)conda**

Anaconda is an open-source solution by [Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io)
for package management and deployment.

**Where are the packages hosted**

Cloud. http://anaconda.org

** Binary compatibilities **
Anaconda builds a software environment of its own with little dependencies on the system,
this allows building single linux binary distribution that works for different flavors
of linux systems. Certainly 32bit system and 64bit system needs different binaries.
Windows and OSX need their own binaries as well.
