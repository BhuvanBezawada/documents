# Multidimensional Plotting Tasks for Release 3.5

This documents aims to keep track of the required tasks which need to be addressed for the current release (3.5).

This will allow us to have an overview of the status quo and how to channel our efforts. Please add your issues to this document and change priorities if needed. Also if you think that we won't resolve something for this release, then add/move it to the [Resolve later](#resolve-later) section.

## Currently being looked at


## Tasks
### Priority High 

##### ~~GIL compatibility with ParaView for LaTeX style labels~~
Owner: Martyn  
Resolve Python issue with LaTeX in VSI

##### Implement a 2D text filter for Peaks in Splatterplot
Owner:  
Utkarsh has provided us with a demo for displaying 2D text on a 3D rendered environment. This needs to be integrated with the PeaksViewer in Splatterplot mode (Anton has the demo code).

##### Check if items of the Kitware contract have been implemented
Owner:  
Go through the list of deliverables and check if they have been implemented (see contract)

##### ~~Cut then Scale issue~~
Owner: Anton  
Currently we can scale and then cut, but there is an issue if we reverse the order. See [here.](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/12368)

##### Artifacts when changing size
Owner:  
When we change the size of the VSI the rendered view does not update. A similar effect happens when we use the PeaksTable in the Splatterplot mode. The issue is caused by applying the old state xml file when switching views.

##### Slice position
Owner:  
It was discussed that we should have an input field to define the slice position for the ThreeSliceView.

##### ~~Zero Memory copies~~
Owner: Steven Hahn  
Investigate zero memory copies
Fixed [here] (https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/pull/13322)

##### Axes and labels improvement
Owner: Anton
This will most likely be an umbrella ticket. Some issues are:  
* Provide TeX-like features
* In Threeslice Mode provide a sensible text size (Note that this will need a newer version of PV.)

##### ~~CutMD in VSI can come back with zero data in it~~
Owner: Owen
We have no ability to remap non-integrated dimensions such that we form a contiguous set of these for generating our 
vtkDataSets. Integrated dimensions interspersed amongst non-integrated dimensions cause empty datasets in the visualisation.
See [here](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/12554)



### Priority Medium

##### ~~Fix Scale Filter~~
Owner: Owen Arnold
The scale filter should work with any vtkPointSet, such as the newly provided vtkStructuredGrids (above)
Fixed [here](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/pull/13528)

##### PipelineBrowser + PropertiesWidget mock ups
Owner:  
Create mock ups for a possible replacement of the pipeline browser and the properties widget


### Priority Low

##### Multiple Windows/Instances
Owner:  
Provide multiple VSI instances. See [here](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/12395).
