## VSI Integration issues
Please see below  a list of issues and how to reproduce them.

### Who is working on what?
Issue 9: Anton


### Possible Prioritization:

General thoughts:
* Issues 6 and 12 probably exist because we cannot select the correct element of the pipeline. Having the pipeline browser back might solve this.
* Issues 2, 5 and 10 seem to be addressed in later versions of PV.
* Issue 9 is something Anton can try to find out more about.
* Issues 1 and 8 seem to be related and seem to be a fundamental issue with PV. So this is probably something that Utkarsh will be able to understand quickly.
* Issue 3 might be a change of the cut filter design. It is worth that Utkarsh verifies this.
* Issue 4 is something which has been there previously, so actually should be part of this task list.
* Issue 11 is something that is probably only related to PV, so it is usfull for Utkarsh to have a look at it.
* Issue 13 would require some input from Utkarsh, since it seems that the instances of PV seem to communicate. 

In terms of rating the issues for Utkarsh:

  1. Issues 1 and 8, which seem related.
  2. Issue 13
  3. Issue 11
  4. Issue 3
  5. The other issues in no order

### List of issues
1. When loading starting the VSI a second time, we get a message pop up: 

    > Replacing existing manager for function : 
    > "COLOR_EDITOR_PANEL" 

2. When switch to QuadView, default grid axis is not on any longer displayed (error message)
3. The cut filter does not seem to have the positioning tool any longer with which the user can manually select a plane
4. First cut then scale does not work
5. Structured data (MDHisto) requires blanking arrays. The Histo data appears as a big box. Blanking arrays seem to be missing.
6. Remove BinMD is not available any longer for rebinned data (probably an issue with active source)
7. ~~When first loading, remove rebinning is available (shouldn’t be)~~ NOT REPRODUCABLE
8. Once output warning report from PV is started, it propagates when VSI is restarted. 
9. Cannot add PeakWS through drag and drop; it thinks it is an MDEventWS and crashes(More tests needed in Splatterplot, when we can load  PeakWS)
10.	Cube axis visibility does not work any longer.
11.	Color bar appears only in SplatterPlot mode. There is no checkbox to enable or disable it.
12.	Apply scale/cut filter, then go to view settings( or anything that can change the focus). We cannot remove the filter any longer.
13. When loading MDEventWS into the VSI and PeakWS into another instance of the VSI, the color scale of the MDEventWS seems to get messed up. It seems that the instances are NOT independent.


### How to reproduce the issues
* Issue 1
  1. Load a sample data set into the VSI
  2. Close the VSI
  3.	Load the sample data set again into the VSI
  4.	Confirm that a pop opens with warnings

* Issue 2
  1.	Will be dealt with when we remove ShowCubeAxes and set CubeAxesVisibility of the representation as Utkarsh suggested.

* Issue 3
  1.	Load a MDEvent sample data set into the VSI
  2.	Swith to Standard View
  3.	Apply the Cut filter
  4.	Confirm that there is no visual slice tool available. There used to be a plane that the user could drag around to define the slice. It is not there any longer.

* Issue 4 (This is an issue which seemed to have existed previously)
  1.	Load a MDEvent sample data set into the VSI
  2.	Switch to Standard View
  3.	Apply the Cut filter, press OK
  4.	Apply the Scale filter
  5.	Confirm that a PV error message appears

* Issue 5
  1.	Load a MDHisto sample data set into the VSI
  2.	Switch to Standard View
  3.	Confirm that it is one big box (it should be a more complex shape). Signals of 0 are replaced by blue boxes

* Issue 6
  1.	Load a MDEvent sample data set into the VSI
  2.	Switch to Standard View
  3.	Press the Rebin button, select BinMD and press Ok
  4.	Confirm that a big box is created (same issue as in Issue5)
  5.	Confirm that when pressing Rebin button, there is no option to Remove rebinning. This should be available, if the active source was a rebinned source.

* Issue 7
  1.	Cannot reproduce

* Issue 8
  1.	Load a sample data set into the VSI
  2.	Close the VSI
  3.	Load the sample data set again into the VSI
  4.	Confirm that a pop opens with warnings 
  5.	Switch to the Standard view
  6.	Press Scale button
  7.	Confirm that the pop up with warnings appears and you cannot set the scale filter. 

* Issue 9
  1.	Load a MDEvent sample data set into the VSI
  2.	Switch to SplatterPlot View
  3.	Drag and Drop a PeaksWorkspace into the VSI
  4.	Confirm that a pop up appears claiming that we try to add an MDEventWorkspace. 
  5.	Confirm that Mantid crashes

* Issue 10
  1.	Load a MDEvent sample data set into the VSI
  2.	Switch to Standard View
  3.	Try to set the cub axes visibility
  4.	Confirm that nothing happens

* Issue 11
  1.	Load a MDEvent sample data set into the VSI
  2.	Switch between Standard View and SplatterPlot View
  3.	Confirm that the Color bar appears in standard view and not in splatterplot view
  4.	Confirm that there doesn’t seem to be an option to set the color bar

* Issue 12
  1.	Load a MDEvent sample data set into the VSI
  2.	Switch to Standard View
  3.	Apply a scale filter ( you should still have the option to delete it)
  4.	Press the ViewSettings button in the menu bar
  5.	Confirm that you cannot delete the filter any longer
  
* Issue 13
  1.	Load a MDEvent sample data set into the VSI
  2.	Look at the color scaling of the rendered image
  3.	Load a PeakWorkspace into a separate instance of the VSI, i.e. don’t use the drag and drop feature to load the VSI
  4.	Confirm that the displayed colors of the rendered MDEvent sample have changed. The two VSI instances seem to communicate.
