A graphical user interface (GUI) is available for running the direct geometry reduction algorithm outlined in Section \ref{sec:Algs}. This is available via the \textit{MantidPlot} analysis workbench. The GUI is launched from within \textit{MantidPlot} from the \textit{Interfaces} menu and selecting the \textit{DGS Reduction} menu entry.
