\section{Motivation}
\label{motivation}
With the advent of new, higher fluxes, neutron sources and new instruments, at ISIS and the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), 
neutron scattering is becoming a widespread tool for new users, without previous experience with this experimental technique. Improvements in computational techniques and higher neutron fluxes allow larger data sets to be acquired faster, so new techniques appeared in recent years (pair distribution function \cite{Egami}, multi angle rotation in time-of-flight spectroscopy, stroboscopic measurements \cite{Nojiri}, in-situ residual stress measurements \cite{Wang}). 

The main difficulty that researches have between experiment and publication
is the lack of a simple, yet powerful tool to perform analysis of their data,
and present it into an useful and attractive way.
Traditionally, each instrument (or similar instruments at a given facility) had it's own software routines, that allow instrument scientists an almost complete control of the development, functionality, and deployment. 
The main disadvantages of this approach is replication of similar functionality between codes at different instruments/facilities, lack of documentation, and sometimes inadequate performance. Attempts were made to unify and re-utilize the code at different facilities, \cite{DAVE, OpenGenie, LAMP} with various amounts of success. 


The Manipulation and Analysis Toolkit for Instrument Data (MANTID) project, was started in 2007 at ISIS, and joined by SNS and HFIR in 2010, with the goal of implementing a new framework for data analysis and visualization for neutron scattering and $\mu SR$ experiments. The main requirements for the project are:
\begin{itemize}
\item provide a technique independent framework to manipulate and visualize data 
\item multiplatform (Linux, Windows, MacOS)
\item freely distributable
\item easily extensible by instrument scientists and users
\item provide both low level functionality for advanced uses, and high level, simple and intuitive interfaces for standard measurements 
\item up to date documentation
\end{itemize}
 


\section{Infrastructure}
\label{infrastructure}
To ensure high performance for data analysis, but also allow flexibility, most of the project it is written in C++, with Python bindings.
 
In order to achieve the sated goals, a large team of more than twenty scientists and software engineers are collaborating on this project, using the trac issue tracking system. Tickets are created for each new feature request or defect, and they are used to trace the changes in the code.

The Mantid repository is hosted on github. To accommodate a large number of changes done daily, developers work on separate branches for each ticket. Each feature branch is merged onto a 'develop' branch whenever new code is ready.
It is only after a ticket as been completely addressed and tested that the code changes on the feature branch are merged onto the 'master' branch from which release builds are made.

In order to ensure quality, the Mantid project uses a continuous integration environment build around the Jenkins continuous integration server. Whenever new code is committed to the 'develop' branch, 'unstable' builds for each supported operating system are started. A build is successful only if it all the automated 'unit tests' pass. A nightly build of the 'master' branch is done once a day. For successful nightly builds, a series of integration 'system tests' are also run. Successful builds that pass all system tests are deployed to the analysis computers. Stable releases of Mantid software occur only after rigorous unscripted testing by the development team.  



\section{Mantid Components}
One of the main design consideration for this project was the separation of data and algorithms. Data containers (called workspaces) and the algorithms compose the central element of Mantid, the Mantid Framework (Figure \ref{fig:Framework}). 

Workspaces can be loaded from various files, from live data streams, or created by different algorithms. They can be manipulated by algorithms, and saved to disk. By default Mantid is using the NeXus format for backup.

The interaction with the Mantid Frameworks occurs through the API. While initially a Matlab API was envisioned, currently the main interactions occur through either the Python API, or through MantidPlot graphical interface. 
\label{components}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Workspaces}
Workspaces are the data containers in Mantid. In addition to the data, workspaces can hold other types of information, such as instrument geometry, lattice parameters and orientation, or sample environment logs. Each workspace also contains a history, a list of algorithms that were used to create that workspace. Depending on the organization of the data, there are various types and subtypes of workspaces.

Matrix workspaces contain data for multiple spectra, in the X, Signal, Error format, where X is a coordinate such as time of flight or energy transfer. If the data has only a histogram representation, the workspace is called Workspace2D. The data acquisition system at SNS allows recording each  detected neutron, and labelling it with time-of-flight, and wall-clock-time stamps. For each spectrum, the EventWorkspace contains a list of events. For convenience with plotting, the event workspaces contain a histogram representation as well, that is being calculated on request. There are various uses for event workspaces. One can filter out unwanted events, such as events recorded during temperature spikes. The other big use for events is allowing novel techniques, such as asynchronous parameter scans (continuous angle scans, temperature scans), and pump probe experiments (pulse magnets, high frequency deformations of materials, and so on).

For data formats that contain different field types, Mantid provides various TableWorkspaces. A table workspace is organized in columns. Each column has a name and a type - the type of the data in that column. Examples of table workspaces are the outputs from the Fit algorithm, and PeaksWorkspaces, a representation of information about Bragg peaks, that is used in crystallography experiments.
 
The last major workspace type is the multi-dimensional workspace, or MDWorkspace. While for matrix workspace there are two dimensions describing a data point (spectrum number and X coordinate), for MDWorkspaces we have between 1 and 9 dimensions. For MDEventWorkspaces, each MDEvent contains coordinates, a weight and an error. It might contain also information about which detector and which run it come from. All MDEvents are contained in MDBoxes. Above a certain threshold, the MDBox becomes an MDGridBox, by splitting into several equal size MDBoxes. This allows for an efficient searching and binning, and allows plotting on an adaptive mesh. MDHistoWorkspaces consist of signal and error arrays on a regular grid.  

\subsection{Algorithms}
Mantid algorithms are procedures to manipulate workspaces. They can be predefined, or written by users, in either C++ or Python. There are various categories for algorithms, like data handling (loading/saving workspaces from/to files), arithmetic (plus, minus, multiply), unit conversions, and technique specific algorithms (powder diffraction, single crystal diffraction, SANS, reflectometry, direct and indirect spectrometry, and $\mu SR$). A particularly important set of algorithms was designed to deal with event data formats, to allow filtering and binning.

Workflow algorithms are provided as well. They are predefined series of steps to analyse particular data types within Mantid, starting from the raw data files from data acquisition systems, and all intermediate stages, up to a format that scientist can work with. 

Simple formatting, and input validation can transform user scripts in algorithms, and the development team can make them available to the entire Mantid community. 


\subsection{Python interface}
The most basic way to interact with the Mantid framework is through the python interface. By including the appropriate Mantid libraries, users can write their own reduction/analysis scripts. All algorithms are automatically exposed to python. In addition, several methods related to workspaces, and other helper objects are available as well. A tutorial of using the Python API can be found in the Documentation section on the Mantid webpage\cite{webpage}.  

Most reduction procedures for a particular instrument follow the same pattern, with minor parameter changes to account for experimental conditions. If there is enough metadata in the input files to get the required parameters, the Python interface allows the reduction process to occur automatically, as soon as the raw data file is saved. This is the case for several instruments at SNS. 

\subsection{MantidPlot}
For the average user, the main interaction with Mantid occurs through the MantidPlot interface (Figure \ref{fig:MantidPlot}). It is a graphical user interface based on QtiPlot\cite{qtiplot}. It allows simple 1D, and 2D plots of the data, and access to VATES interface for MDWorkspaces. Accessing the Python interface can be achieved through either the script window (run entire scripts at once) or the script interpreter (execute interactively single commands).

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{MantidPlot.png}}
\caption{MantidPlot interface, showing 1D, and 2D plots. Lists of workspaces and algorithms are available on the right side}
\label{fig:MantidPlot}
\end{figure}
A list of available workspace is present by default. Clicking on the workspaces show information about workspace type and content. A context sensitive menu allows simple plotting, instrument view, inspection of the sample environment logs, or a listing of the history of the workspace.

A list of all algorithms is also present by default, organized both alphabetically, and by category. Clicking on an algorithm will open an automatically generated dialog box, with entries for each of the input parameters. A quick validation occurs when information is filled, and if any input is invalid it is going to be flagged. For each algorithm dialog box, a button allows for invoking the built-in help.

A results log window is also available, where users can see the results of running different algorithms.

For several scientific techniques, custom interfaces are available from the MantidPlot menu.



\subsection{Custom User Interfaces}
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Hyspec.png}}
\caption{Custom interface for direct geometry reduction on HYSPEC instrument}
\label{fig:Hyspec}
\end{figure}
Reduction scripts for several scientific techniques can be complicated, and depending on a large number of parameters. One can use either scripts of workflow algorithms to manipulate the raw data. The complexity of scripts can be intimidating for new users, while auto-generated dialog boxes for workflow algorithms can be unintuitive as well. For a few cases, that often used at different instruments, the development team has created custom user interfaces.

The custom user interfaces, available from MantidPlot, group together inputs from related reduction parameters, and spread independent steps onto different tabs. Figure \ref{fig:Hyspec}, shows the DGS Reduction interface for the HYSPEC instrument at SNS. When it is executed on computers with certain privileges, different option can appear or disappear, like live data analysis, or sending reduction jobs to particular computing clusters.


\subsection{VATES}
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{VSI-v2-SplatterPlot.png}}
\caption{VSI in splatter plot mode with single crystal data from TOPAZ difractometer.}
\label{fig:VSI_sample}
\end{figure}
For visualizing 3 and 4 dimension datasets, Mantid provides the VATES Simple Interface (\textit{VSI}), that offers a stock set of data views and access to a subset of Mantid algorithms. It is based on application widgets and rendering libraries from the ParaView\cite{paraview} visualization program. The \textit{VSI}$\*$ takes advantage of the ParaView plugin architecture to provide functionality from within Mantid and from within ParaView standalone. The data in Mantid to be visualized passes through an API layer which translates the internal Mantid data structure to a VTK\cite{vtk} data structure, that can be rendered in the \textit{VSI}$\*$. Those same data structures can be saved to file and visualized in the ParaView program. The API layer provides the desired decoupling of the data structures and provides good flexibility to handle the various needs of the Mantid data structures and algorithms. 

\begin{figure}[!hb]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{NonOrthogonalProjection_W.png}}
\caption{Volume rendering of Gd excitations, in ParaView. Data was measured on SEQUOIA spectrometer at SNS.}
\label{fig:ParaView_sample}
\end{figure}

The \textit{VSI}$\*$ has a view called MultiSlice which allows placing multiple orthogonal slices on the data. Those slices can then alternately be viewed in SliceViewer. The SplatterPlot (Figure 1) view is oriented towards visualizing peaks in single crystal diffraction data. In that view, there is a pick mode which can interact with Mantid to retrieve information about a selected peak. The ThreeSlice view shows three orthogonal planes through the data with the capability exploring via moving a crosshair in one of the planes with a coordinate readout in each plane to show the location. The \textit{VSI}$\*$ has the ability to show the data with non-orthogonal axes such as the data in Figure 2. This capability was implemented by Kitware\cite{kitware} via the SNS in support of the Mantid project.






\section{Conclusion}
The Mantid project offers an extensible framework for data manipulation, analysis and visualization, geared toward neutron scattering and $\mu SR$ experiments. It is the main reduction software in use at SNS and ISIS, and partially in use or considered at several other scientific facilities. Up to date information, and usage tutorials can be found on the Mantid web page\cite{webpage}. 

The development team would like to thank various instrument scientists for their feedback. Work at ORNL was sponsored by the Scientific User Facilities Division, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, US Department of Energy.
