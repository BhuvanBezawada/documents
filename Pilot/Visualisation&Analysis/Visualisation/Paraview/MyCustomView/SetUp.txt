DESCRIPTION: Minimal proof of concept for providing custom/bespoke view for ParaView

PLATFORM DETAILS:

Windows: 64-bit Windows 7. Build using VS 2005 C++ (no sevice packs). Make using CMake 2.8.1

Linux: Unconfirmed, but no issues expected

Mac: Unconfirmed

KNOWN ISSUES: None

SETUP DETAILS:

1) Download the Paraview source code for Paraview 3.8 from http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html
2) Create a new folder called 'MyCustomView' under the Paraview/Examples/CustomApplications directory
3) Copy the following to the newly created directory:
    MyCustomWindow.h
	MyCustomWindow.cxx
	Consumer.cxx
	CMakeList.txt
4) In the CMake.txt file in the parent directory (Paraview/Examples/CustomApplications) modify the following to include MyCustomView

  SUBDIRS(
    ...
	MyCustomView
    )


5) Build using CMake, ensure that BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARIES option is selected. 
6) Open the top level Paraview solution file and build everything (the build can take a long time first time round).
7) Run MyCustomView.exe

EXPECTED OUTPUT: 

Should have generated a custom view containing the paraview main display window.
