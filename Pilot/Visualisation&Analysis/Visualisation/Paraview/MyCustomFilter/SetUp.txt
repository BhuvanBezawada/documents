DESCRIPTION: Minimal proof of concept for providing custom/bespoke VTK filter plugins for Paraview.

PLATFORM DETAILS:

Windows: 64-bit Windows 7. Build using VS 2005 C++ (no sevice packs). Make using CMake 2.8.1

Linux: Unconfirmed, but no issues expected

Mac: Unconfirmed

KNOWN ISSUES: None

SETUP DETAILS:

1) Download the Paraview source code for Paraview 3.8 from http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.html
2) Create a new folder called 'MyCustomFilter' under the Paraview/Plugins directory
3) Copy the following to the newly created directory:
    vktMyCustomFilter.h
	vktMyCustomFilter.cpp
	MyCustomFilter.xml
	CMakeList.txt
4) In the CMake.txt file in the parent directory (Paraview/Plugins) add the line

paraview_build_optional_plugin(MyCustomFilter "My Custom Filter" MyCustomFilter ON) 

under the existing line

paraview_build_optional_plugin(PointSprite "Point Sprites" PointSprite ON) 

5) Build using CMake, ensure that BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARIES option is selected. 
6) Open the top level Paraview solution file and build everything (the build can take a long time first time round).
7) Verify that MyCustomFilter.dll has been build to the output build directory.
8) Run Paraview (paraview.exe)
    i) Go to 'Source' on the menu and select 'Sphere'
	ii) Set theta resolution to 400 and psi resolution to 400
	iii) select 'Apply' from the filter properties window to draw the sphere
	iiii) Go to Tools menu, select 'Manage Plugins' then locate and load MyCustomFilter.dll from the file system
	iv) Go to 'Filters' -> 'Alphabetic' and select 'CustomFilter'.
	v) Select 'Apply' from the filter properties window.
	vi) Select the Sphere Source from the pipeline and change the theata resolution to 600 and click 'Apply'
	vii) Verify that the text "Working Very Hard" appears in the progress message window on the bottom right of the paraview screen
	

EXPECTED OUTPUT: 

Should write "Working Very Hard" in progress message box on bottom right of Paraview GUI when
any processing is occuring.
